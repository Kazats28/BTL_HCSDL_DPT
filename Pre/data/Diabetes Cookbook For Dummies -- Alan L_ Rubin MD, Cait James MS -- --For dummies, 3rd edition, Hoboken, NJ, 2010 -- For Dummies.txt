Rubin, MD, is one of the nations foremost experts on diabetes. He is a professional member of the American Diabetes Association and the Endocrine Society and has been in private practice specializing in diabetes and thyroid disease for over 30 years. Dr. Rubin was assistant clinical profes-sor of medicine at University of California Medical Center in San Francisco for 20 years. He has spoken about diabetes to professional medical audiences and nonmedical audiences around the world. He has been a consultant to many pharmaceutical companies and companies that make diabetes products.

Dr. Rubin was one of the first specialists in his field to recognize the significance of patient self-testing of blood glucose, the major advance in diabetes care since the advent of insulin.

His first book, Diabetes For Dummies, now in a third edition, is a basic reference for any nonprofessional who wants to understand diabetes. It has sold more than 1 million copies and has been translated into 15 languages including French, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian.

This led her to Kaiser Permanentes Pediatric Clinic, working with children suffering from or at risk of medical complications due to weight. While she now oversees a wide variety of health promotion programs for patients and staff, the promotion of healthy nutrition choices continues to be her biggest passion. She loves great food and wine, so thankfully she balances it with avid running and yoga!

We dont have to prove that statement anymore. The recipes in Dr. Rubins previous book, Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), and the second edition of this book show that people can follow a diabetic diet at home or anywhere they travel and still enjoy a five-star meal. They just have to know how to cook it or where to go to get it.

More and more eating is being done away from home or, if at home, from food in the form of take-out from a local supermarket or restaurant, and people with diabetes want to know what they can and cant eat.

If you bought Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, you know that you can find such food in Chicago, New York City, Santa Monica, and San Francisco. But what about the rest of the world? This book is both a cookbook that shows you how to prepare great foods in your own home and a guide to eating out in restaurants and fast-food places.

Is diet important for a person with diabetes? Do salmon swim upstream? The Diabetes Control and Complications Trials showed that a good diabetic diet could lower the hemoglobin A1c, a test of overall blood glucose control, by over 1 percent. That much improvement will result in a reduction of complications of diabetes such as eye disease, nerve disease, and kidney disease by 25 percent or more. The progression of complications that have already started to occur can be significantly slowed.

Of course, theres much more to managing diabetes than diet alone. In this book, you can discover the place of diet in a complete program of diabetes care.

This edition will feature a lot more about vegetarian eating. People who eat that way tend to be lighter and healthier. Many of the animal protein recipes in previous editions will be replaced by vegetarian food. We have tried them all, and they are delicious. We hope you will agree.

Cherry pie is good. But if you eat a whole lot of it, its going to make you sick.

2 Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition About This Book You wouldnt read a cookbook from cover to cover, and this book is no exception to that rule. Theres no reason to read about setting up your kitchen if you simply want a place to eat in New York where you can find healthy nutrition for your diabetes. You may want to read the first few chapters to get an overview of the place of diet in your overall diabetes management, but if you just need a great entree for tonights supper or a great restaurant wherever you are, go right to that information. The book is written to be understood no matter where you find yourself in it.

Conventions Used in This Book The recipes in this book are produced in a standard form that tells you what youre cooking, how much youre cooking, and how to cook it. The preparation time, cooking time (which is in addition to the prep time), and yield, or number of servings, are all presented at the beginning of the recipe, followed by a list of ingredients. We suggest that you always read through a recipe completely before you start preparing it so that you can make sure you have all the ingredients and equipment you need.

Chefs sometimes use exotic ingredients that may not be easily available to you. With the permission of the chefs, we have tried to substitute more common ingredients. On the other hand, walking into a store that sells special ingredients for a Chinese meal or an Indian meal, for example, can be a fascinating experience. We always define ingredients that are unfamiliar to English-speaking eaters in the introduction to the recipe.

You can find nutrition information at the end of every recipe so that you can incorporate the recipe into your nutrition plan. The nutrition information is always given in the following order:  Kcalories (see Chapter 1)  Kcalories from fat  Grams of fat  Grams of saturated fat  Milligrams of cholesterol  Milligrams of sodium Introduction 3  Grams of carbohydrate  Grams of fiber  Grams of protein If salt is listed in a recipe as an optional ingredient or listed to taste, it isnt figured into the nutritional information; but if a specific amount of salt is listed in the recipe, that amount is calculated into the nutritional information.

Serving sizes are always calculated as the total recipe divided by the number of servings listed at the beginning of the recipe.

Here are a few other guidelines to keep in mind about the recipes:  All butter is unsalted. Margarine is not a suitable substitute for butter, because of the difference in flavor and nutritional value. Butter is a natural product, while margarine is man-made and contains trans fatty acids.

All eggs are large.

All flour is all-purpose unless otherwise specified.

All milk is lowfat unless otherwise specified.

All onions are yellow unless otherwise specified.

All pepper is freshly ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.

All salt is table salt unless otherwise specified.

All mentions of Splenda refer to the regular sugar substitute unless Splenda for Baking is specified.

All dry ingredient measurements are level  use a dry ingredient measuring cup, fill it to the top, and scrape it even with a straight object, such as the flat side of a knife.

All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (See Appendix D for information about converting temperatures to Celsius.)  A handful of recipes that appeared in the first edition of this book are featured in this edition and called Classics in their recipe names.

T If you need or want vegetarian recipes, scan the list of Recipes in This Chapter on the first page of each chapter in Part II. A little tomato, rather than a triangle, in front of the name of a recipe marks that recipe as vegetarian. (See the tomato to the left of this paragraph.) This isnt a complete book about diagnosing and treating diabetes and its complications. Check out Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, if you need diagnosis and treatment information.

4 Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition What Youre Not to Read All For Dummies books have shaded areas called sidebars. They contain interesting but nonessential information. If you arent interested in the nitty-gritty, you can skip these sidebars. We promise not to include that information on the test.

Foolish Assumptions The book assumes that youve done some cooking, youre familiar with the right knife to use to slice an onion without cutting your finger, and you can tell one pot from another. Beyond that, you can find many cooking terms in Appendix C at the end of the book.

How This Book Is Organized The book is divided into five parts to help you incorporate the benefits of a good diet into your diabetes management program, while showing you that the food can be great.

Part I: Thriving with Diabetes This part takes you on the road to long life and great health as you incorporate the needs of being a person with diabetes into the rest of your life.

It begins by showing you all aspects of a healthy lifestyle and continues by focusing on food and its importance to you. When you cook for a person with diabetes (either yourself or a loved one), you must keep some special considerations in mind, but this part shows you that a diet for diabetes is an excellent diet for anyone. We guide you around the kitchen and take you to the supermarket to find out about meal-enhancing ingredients, as well as the ones to bypass as you navigate the aisles.

Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great This part presents recipes from A to Z (apples to zucchini) and everything in between. The chapters take you through your eating day, starting with your breakfast, providing snacks for midmorning and midafternoon, and offering larger meals at lunch and dinner. They end, naturally, with wonderful desserts, which show that youre not doomed to give up what you may consider Introduction 5 the best part of the meal. You just need to be careful about calories. In this part, we feature the recipes from the great restaurants that have participated in the creation of this book.

Part III: Eating Away from Home In this book, we cant cover every city and every restaurant you may visit.

What do you do if you find yourself without a suggestion from this book?

Part III tells you how to eat well and stay healthy wherever you are. You can always visit a fast-food franchise, but a lot of that food isnt good for you.

If you pick and choose well, however, youll be able to select a meal even when your only choice is the one fast-food restaurant off the next exit on the freeway.

Part IV: The Part of Tens We love to help you solve your problems in groups of ten. If you have 13 problems, youll just have to wait for the next book to solve the last 3. In this part, we provide ten steps to improve your eating habits and ten food substitutions that you can easily make within a recipe. You can explore ten strategies to normalize your blood glucose and ten ways to promote healthy eating in children.

Part V: Appendixes Appendix A has info about the restaurants that provided many of the delicious recipes in this book. You find out about their particular style of cooking and the chefs who make this possible. Appendix B contains a glossary of key cooking terms. In Appendix C, you can find guidelines if you want to substitute other sweeteners for sugar, as well as cooking equivalents, such as how many tablespoons make up a cup. Appendix D offers other resources in books and on the Web for recipes and nutritional information for people with diabetes.

Icons Used in This Book The icons in this book are like bookmarks, pointing out information that we think is especially important. You may want to pick out one particular icon that appeals to you. For example, if you like stories about people, the Anecdote icon is for you. The Anecdote icon points you to a lot of interesting 6 Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition stories about others with diabetes and how they cope with their diets. If your interests lie in the direction of very mild fear, look for the Warning icon. Here are the icons used in this book: We use this icon whenever Dr. Rubin tells a story about his patients.

Whenever we want to emphasize the importance of the current information to your nutritional plan, we use this icon.

When you see the Remember icon, pay special attention because the information is essential.

This icon flags situations when you should see your doctor (for example, if your blood glucose level is too high or you need a particular test done).

This helpful icon marks important information that can save you time and energy.

Watch for this icon; it warns about potential problems (for example, the possible results if you dont treat a condition).

Where to Go from Here Where you go from here depends on your immediate needs. If you want an introduction to the place of nutrition in diabetes management, start with Chapter 1. If you are hungry and want some lunch, go to Chapter 8 or 9. If you are about to travel or eat out, head for Part III. At any time, the Part of Tens can provide useful tips for healthy eating. Finally, the appendixes help you cook for yourself or choose a restaurant. Feel free to jump around, but take the time to go through Part II so that you realize that diabetes and great food are not mutually exclusive.

Recognizing Diabetes With so much diabetes around these days, you may think that recognizing it should be easy. The truth is that its not easy, because diabetes is defined by blood tests. You cant just look at someone and know the level of glucose  blood sugar  in his or her blood.

10 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Diabetes by the numbers The level of glucose that means you have diabetes is as follows:  A casual blood glucose of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) or more at any time of day or night, along with symptoms such as fatigue, frequent urination and thirst, slow healing of skin, urinary infections, and vaginal itching in women. A normal casual blood glucose should be between 70 and 139 mg/dl.

A fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dl or more after no food for at least eight hours. A normal fasting blood glucose should be less than 100 mg/dl.

A blood glucose of 200 mg/dl or greater two hours after consuming 75 grams of glucose.

A diagnosis of diabetes requires at least two abnormal levels on two different occasions. Dont accept a lifelong diagnosis of diabetes on the basis of a single test.

A fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl or casual blood glucose between 140 and 199 mg/dl is prediabetes. See Dr. Rubins book Prediabetes For Dummies (Wiley). Most people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within ten years. Although people with prediabetes dont usually develop small blood vessel complications of diabetes like blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage, theyre more prone to large vessel disease like heart attacks and strokes, so you want to get that level of glucose down. Sixty million people in the United States have prediabetes.

Types of diabetes The following list describes the three main types of diabetes:  Type 1 diabetes: This used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes. It mostly begins in childhood and results from the bodys self-destruction of its own pancreas. The pancreas is an organ of the body that sits behind the stomach and makes insulin, the chemical or hormone that gets glucose into cells where it can be used. You cant live without insulin, so people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin shots. Of the 24 million Americans with diabetes, about 10 percent have type 1.

Type 2 diabetes: Once called adult-onset diabetes, type 2 used to begin around the age of 40, but it is occurring more often in children, many of whom are getting heavier and heavier and exercising less and less. The problem in type 2 diabetes is not a total lack of insulin, as occurs in type 1, but a resistance to the insulin, so that the glucose still doesnt get into cells but remains in the blood.

Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes 11  Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes is like type 2 diabetes but occurs in women during pregnancy, when a lot of chemicals in the mothers blood oppose the action of insulin. About 4 percent of all pregnancies are complicated by gestational diabetes. If the mother isnt treated to lower the blood glucose, the glucose gets into the babys bloodstream. The baby produces plenty of insulin and begins to store the excess glucose as fat in all the wrong places. If this happens, the baby may be larger than usual and therefore may be hard to deliver. When the baby is born, he is cut off from the large sugar supply but is still making lots of insulin, so his blood glucose can drop severely after birth. The mother is at risk of gestational diabetes in later pregnancies and of type 2 diabetes as she gets older.

Other types: A small group of people with diabetes suffer from one of these much less common varieties of diabetes:  Latent autoimmune diabetes on adults (LADA), which has characteristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes  Genetic defects of the beta cell, which makes insulin  Medications that affect insulin action like cortisol or prednisone  Diseases or conditions that damage the pancreas like pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis  Genetic defects in insulin action Consequences of diabetes If your blood glucose isnt controlled  that is, kept between 70 and 139 mg/ dl after eating or under 100 mg/dl fasting  damage can occur to your body.

The damage can be divided into three categories: irritations, short-term complications, and long-term complications.

Irritations Irritations are mild and reversible but still unpleasant results of high blood glucose levels. The levels arent so high that the person is in immediate life-threatening danger. The most important of these irritations are the following:  Blurred vision  Fatigue  Frequent urination and thirst  Genital itching, especially in females  Gum and urinary tract infections  Obesity  Slow healing of the skin 12 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Short-term complications These complications can be very serious and lead to death if not treated.

Theyre associated with very high levels of blood glucose  in the 400s and above. The three main short-term complications are the following:  Ketoacidosis: This complication is found mostly in type 1 diabetes. It is a severe acid condition of the blood that results from lack of insulin, the hormone that is missing. The patient becomes very sick and will die if not treated with large volumes of fluids and large amounts of insulin.

After the situation is reversed, however, the patient is fine.

Hyperosmolar syndrome: This condition is often seen in neglected older people. Their blood glucose rises due to severe dehydration and the fact that the kidneys of the older population cant get rid of glucose the way younger kidneys can. The blood becomes like thick syrup. The person can die if large amounts of fluids arent restored. They dont need that much insulin to recover. After the condition is reversed, these people can return to a normal state.

Hypoglycemia or low blood glucose: This complication happens when the patient is on a drug like insulin or a pill that drives the glucose down but isnt getting enough food or is getting too much exercise. After it falls below 70 mg/dl, the patient begins to feel bad. Typical symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hunger, nervousness, confusion, and coma if the low glucose is prolonged. Glucose by mouth, or by venous injection if the person is unconscious, is the usual treatment. This complication usually causes no permanent damage.

Long-term complications These problems occur after ten or more years of poorly controlled diabetes or, in the case of the macrovascular complications, after years of prediabetes or diabetes. They have a substantial impact on quality of life. After these complications become established, reversing them is hard, but treatment is available for them early in their course, so watch for them five years after your initial diagnosis of diabetes. See Dr. Rubins book Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), for information on screening for these complications.

The long-term complications are divided into two groups: microvascular, which are due at least in part to small blood vessel damage, and macrovascular, associated with damage to large blood vessels.

Microvascular complications include the following:  Diabetic retinopathy: Eye damage that leads to blindness if untreated.

Diabetic nephropathy: Kidney damage that can lead to kidney failure.

Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes 13  Diabetic neuropathy: Nerve damage that results in many clinical symptoms, the most common of which are tingling and numbness in the feet.

Lack of sensation in the feet can result in severe injury without awareness unless you carefully look at your feet regularly. Such injury can result in infection and even amputation.

Macrovascular complications also occur in prediabetes and consist of the following:  Arteriosclerotic heart disease: Blockage of the blood vessels of the heart. This is the most common cause of death in diabetes due to a heart attack.

Arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease: Blockage of blood vessels to the brain, resulting in a stroke.

Arteriosclerotic peripheral vascular disease involving the blood vessels of the legs: These vessels can become clogged and result in amputation of the feet or legs.

If you control your blood glucose, none of these complications need ever occur. Controlling your blood pressure and your cholesterol also helps prevent these complications.

Treating diabetes Treatment of diabetes involves three essential elements:  Diet: If you follow the recommendations in this book, you can lower your average blood glucose by as much as 30 to 50 mg/dl. Doing so can reduce the complication rate by as much as 33 percent.

Exercise: We touch on exercise in Chapter 3 and cover it more extensively in Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley).

Medication: Diabetes medications abound  there are far too many to discuss here, but you can find out about them in Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition.

Controlling Calories Just as the three most important factors in the value of a house are location, location, location, the three most important factors in diet for people with diabetes are moderation, moderation, moderation. If youre overweight or obese, which is true of most people with type 2 diabetes and a lot of people with type 1 diabetes who are on intensive insulin treatment (four shots of 14 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes insulin daily), weight loss will make a huge difference in your blood glucose levels. If you maintain the weight loss, youll avoid the complications of diabetes discussed earlier in this chapter.

To successfully lose weight, you need to control your total calories. You must burn up the same amount of calories you take in by mouth, or you will gain weight. To lose weight, you need to burn up more calories than you eat. Sounds simple, eh! And it doesnt matter where the calories come from.

Studies that compare diets low in fats, proteins, or carbohydrates result in the same weight loss after a year.

As you reduce your portions, reduce your intake of added sugars, fats, and alcohol. These items contain no nutrients such as vitamins and minerals and are simply sources of empty calories.

If you are predisposed to have diabetes because, for example, your parents both had diabetes, you can prevent it by maintaining a healthy weight. If you already have diabetes, you can minimize its impact by losing weight and keeping it off.

Do you need a highly complicated formula to figure out how to moderate your food intake? No! Its as simple as looking at the portions you currently eat and cutting them in half. At home, where you control the amount of food on your plate, you can start with a small portion, so you may not need to reduce it by half. However, in restaurants, where more and more people are eating their meals, especially the fast-food restaurants, discussed extensively in Chapters 17 and 18, the rule of eating half may not be strong enough.

There you may need to eat only a third of the portion. You may need to apply the same portion control when you eat at someone elses home. Figure 1-1 shows you the difference between reasonably sized portions and ones that are too big.

Use these tips to help you visualize portion sizes:  An ounce of meat is the size of a pack of matches.

Three ounces of meat is the size of a deck of cards.

A medium fruit is the size of a tennis ball.

A medium potato is the size of a computer mouse.

A medium bagel is the size of a hockey puck.

An ounce of cheese is the size of a domino.

A cup of fruit is the size of a baseball.

A cup of broccoli is the size of a light bulb.

Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes 15 Figure 1-1: Eating in modera- tion means choosing the portion sizes on the left, rather than those on the right.

You dont need to take in many extra calories over time to gain weight. Just 100 extra kilocalories (see the Kilocalories versus calories sidebar for an explanation of kilocalories) on a daily basis results in a weight gain of 12 pounds in a year. An extra glass of wine is that many kilocalories. On the other hand, if you reduce your daily intake by 100 kilocalories, you can lose those 12 pounds over a year.

Look at a few examples of the portion sizes provided today compared to 20 years ago. Table 1-1 shows the kilocalories in the portions of 20 years ago and today and how much exercise you have to do to burn up the extra kilocalories so you dont gain weight.

Table 1-1 Consequences of Todays Larger Portions Food Kilocalories 20 Kilocalories Exercise to burn the years ago today difference Bagel 140 350 50 minutes raking leaves Cheeseburger 333 590 90 minutes lifting weights French fries 210 610 80 minutes walking Turkey sandwich 320 820 85 minutes biking Coffee 45 350 70 minutes walking Chicken Caesar 390 790 80 minutes walking salad Popcorn 270 630 75 minutes of water aerobics Chocolate chip 55 275 75 minutes washing cookie the car 16 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Kilocalories versus calories I use the term kilocalories (or kcalories) rather and in diets, and health officials dont want to than calories because experts in health and confuse the public by attempting to correct this medicine measure energy in a diet plan or in error.

food in kilocalories (a kilocalorie is 1,000 times greater than a calorie). Unfortunately, the term Calorie counts in the text of this book and in the calories has been established on food labels nutritional analyses of the recipes are given in kilocalories.

Including Exercise (And Rest) Exercise is just as important as diet in controlling your blood glucose. A group of people who were expected to develop diabetes because their parents both had diabetes was asked to walk 30 minutes a day. Eighty percent of those who did walk did not develop the disease. These people didnt necessarily lose weight, but they did exercise.

Too many people complain that they just cant find the time to exercise. But a recent study showed that just 712 minutes of highly intense exercise a week had a profound effect on the blood glucose. So this excuse isnt acceptable, especially when you realize how much difference exercise can make in your life and your diabetes. Here are some ways that different amounts of exercise can help you:  Thirty minutes of exercise a day will get you in excellent physical shape and reduce your blood glucose substantially.

Sixty minutes of exercise a day will help you to maintain weight loss and get you in even better physical shape.

Ninety minutes of exercise a day will cause you to lose weight.

An exercise partner helps ensure that you get out and do your thing. We find it extremely helpful to have someone waiting for us so that we can exercise together.

Here are some more facts about exercise to keep in mind:  You dont have to get in all your minutes of exercise in one session. Two 30-minute workouts are just as good as and possibly better than one 60-minute workout.

Although walking is excellent exercise, especially for the older population, the benefits of more vigorous exercise and for a longer time are greater still.

Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes 17  Everything counts when it comes to exercise. Your decision to take the stairs instead of the elevator may not seem like much, but if you do so day after day, it makes a profound difference. Another suggestion that may help over time is to park your car farther from your office or bike to the office.

A pedometer (a small gadget worn on your belt that counts your steps) may help you to achieve your exercise goals. The objective is to get up to 10,000 steps a day by increasing your step count every week.

You also want to do something to strengthen your muscles. Larger muscles take in more glucose, providing another way of keeping it under control.

Youll be surprised by how much your stamina will increase and how much your blood glucose will fall.

Place a daily limit on activities that are completely sedentary, such as watching television or surfing the Web. Use the time you might have once spent on these activities to exercise. This advice is especially helpful for overweight children who should be limited to two hours a day.

You want to be active, but dont do it at the cost of getting plenty of rest each day. People who sleep eight hours a night tend to be less hungry and leaner than people who sleep less.

Of course, it is possible to overdo it. One French diplomat found the phenomenal energy of President Theodore Roosevelt too much for him. After two sets of tennis at the White House, Roosevelt invited him to go jogging. Then they had a workout with a medicine ball. What would you like to do now? the president asked his guest when his enthusiasm for the exercise seem to be flagging. If its all the same to you, gasped the exhausted Frenchman, lie down and die.

If you want to be sure that the sites you 18 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Controlling Your Blood Pressure Keeping your blood pressure in check is particularly important in preventing the macrovascular complications of diabetes. But elevated blood pressure also plays a role in bringing on eye disease, kidney disease, and neuropathy.

You should have your blood pressure tested every time you see your doctor.

The goal is to keep your blood pressure under 130/80. (See Dr. Rubins book High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd edition, published by Wiley, for a complete explanation of the meaning of these numbers.) You may want to get your own blood pressure monitor so that you can check it at home yourself.

The statistics about diabetes and high blood pressure are daunting. Seventy-one percent of diabetics have high blood pressure, but almost a third are unaware of it. Almost half of them werent being treated for high blood pressure. Among the treated patients, less than half were treated in a way that reduced their pressure to lower than 130/80.

You can do plenty of things to lower your blood pressure, including losing weight, avoiding salt, eating more fruits and vegetables, and, of course, exercising. But if all else fails, your doctor may prescribe medication. Many blood pressure medicines are available, and one or two will be exactly right for you.

See High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition, for an extensive discussion of the large number of blood pressure medications.

One class of drugs in particular is very useful for people with diabetes with high blood pressure: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), which are especially protective of your kidneys. If kidney damage is detected early, ACE inhibitors can reverse the damage. Some experts believe that all diabetics should take ACE inhibitors. We believe that if theres no evidence of kidney damage and the diabetes is well controlled, this isnt necessary.

Considering the Rest of Your Lifestyle Diabetes is just one part of your life. It can affect the rest of your lifestyle, however, and your lifestyle certainly affects your diabetes. In this section, we take up some of these other parts of your lifestyle, all of which you can alter to the benefit of your health and your diabetes. Try making changes one at a time, and when you think you have that one under control, move on to the next.

Drinking alcohol safely A glass of wine is a pleasant addition to dinner, and studies show that alcohol in moderation can lower the risk of a heart attack. For a diabetic, it is especially important that food accompany the wine because alcohol reduces the Chapter 1: What It Means to Thrive with Diabetes 19 blood glucose; a complication called hypoglycemia may occur (see the section Short-term complications, earlier in this chapter).

Never drink alcohol without food, especially when youre taking glucose-lowering medication.

The following people should not drink alcohol at all:  Pregnant women  Women who are breastfeeding  Children and adolescents  People who take medications that interact with alcohol  People with medical conditions that are worsened by alcohol, such as liver disease and certain diseases of the pancreas The amount of wine that is safe on a daily basis is a maximum of two 4-ounce glasses for a man or one 4-ounce glass for a woman. Men metabolize alcohol more rapidly than women, so they can drink more. But you should drink no more than a maximum of five days out of seven.

In terms of alcohol content, 112 ounces of hard liquor, such as gin, rum, vodka, or whisky, or 12 ounces of light beer are the equivalent of a 4-ounce glass of wine.

Alcohol adds calories without any nutrition. Alcohol has no vitamins or minerals, but you do have to account for the calories in your diet. If you stop drinking alcohol, you may lose a significant amount of weight. For example, a person who has been drinking three drinks a night and stops will lose 26 pounds in a year.

Alcohol can cause cirrhosis of the liver and raises blood pressure. It also worsens diabetic neuropathy. Do you need any more reasons not to drink alcohol?

In addition to drinking alcohol in moderation, here are major ways you can improve the rest of your lifestyle:  Avoid tobacco in any form. It is the number-one killer.

Avoid illicit drugs.

Drive safely.

Benefit from relationships.

As defined by a body mass index of 30 m2 or greater, the percent of Americans who were obese went from 23.9 in 2005 to 25.6 in 2007. During the same period, the prevalence of people with a diagnosis of diabetes went from 20.8 million in 2005 to 23.6 million in 2007.

The United States must reverse this trend. Otherwise, millions of people will become blind, develop kidney failure, and require amputations. In addition, millions of people will become heart attack victims, many of whom will not survive their first heart attack.

Diet can lower the hemoglobin A1c, a measure of the average glucose in the blood for the last 90 days, by 1 percent or more. For every 1 percent reduction in hemoglobin A1c, there is a 33 percent reduction in complications of diabetes. See Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), for more information on hemoglobin A1c.

This chapter tells you how much to eat, what to eat, and when to eat.

Because most people with diabetes are overweight, I provide advice so that eating healthy becomes a way of life for you. And dont forget the important value of exercise, particularly skipping soda, skipping fatty foods, and skipping desserts.

22 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes The first thing you need to know when you plan your diet is how much you should be eating. To find out how many kilocalories (commonly called calories) you need, you have to do a little math. Chapter 3 shows you how to determine your ideal weight and the number of kilocalories you need, depending on your lifestyle and weight goals.

After you know your total calorie intake objective, break it down into the three sources of energy: carbohydrates, protein, and fat.

Considering a Vegetarian Diet The evidence for the benefits of vegetarian eating for your health is growing.

There are several degrees of vegetarian eating:  Vegan leaves out all animal meats and products including dairy.

Lacto-ovo vegetarian includes eggs, milk, and milk products.

Pesco-vegetarian includes fish with eggs, milk, and milk products.

A study in the May 2009 issue of Diabetes Care compared the eating patterns in Seventh Day Adventists, a group in whom there were different patterns of vegetarianism. The study found that the group that followed a vegan diet had the lowest average body mass index (BMI), 23.6, while lacto-ovo vegetarians had a BMI of 25.7, pesco-vegetarians had a BMI of 26.3, and nonvegetarians had an average BMI of 28.8. The prevalence of diabetes increased from 2.9 percent in vegans to 7.6 percent in nonvegetarians.

A second key study in the March 2007 issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine looked at 322,263 men and 223,390 women who provided detailed histories of their diet and other habits including smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption, education, weight, and family history of cancer. Over the course of ten years, 47,976 men and 23,276 women died. Their meat consumption varied from 1 ounce to 4 ounces a day and processed meat (like hot dogs, salami, etc.) ranged from once a week to one and one half ounces a day. The number of excess deaths attributed to high meat consumption was large. The authors drew the following conclusions:  If these groups are representative of all Americans, over the course of a decade, the deaths of 1 million men and half a million women could be prevented by eating less red and processed meats.

People should eat a hamburger only once or twice a week maximum.

People should eat steak only once a week maximum.

People should eat processed meats less than once in six weeks.

Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 23 The study didnt begin to calculate the benefits to the environment of producing much less meat, which are enormous.

As a result of studies like these and many others, we are emphasizing vegetarian eating much more in this edition and may, perhaps, publish a whole edition of vegetarian recipes. Whether you will benefit is entirely up to you.

Calculating Carbohydrates  Precursors of Glucose When you eat a meal, the immediate source of glucose in your blood comes from the carbohydrates in that meal. One group of carbohydrates is the starches, such as cereals, grains, pastas, breads, crackers, starchy vegetables, beans, peas, and lentils. Fruits make up a second major source of carbohydrate. Milk and milk products contain not only carbohydrate but also protein and a variable amount of fat, depending on whether the milk is whole, lowfat, or fat-free. Other sources of carbohydrate include cakes, cookies, candies, sweetened beverages, and ice cream. These foods also contain a variable amount of fat.

To determine what else is found in food, check a source such as The Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges, published by the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association, or The Diabetes Carbohydrate and Fat Gram Guide, published by the American Diabetes Association.

Determining the amount of carbohydrate How much carbohydrate should you have in your diet? The current recommendation is between 40 to 65 percent of daily calories. In our experience, those who keep their carbohydrate intake on the lower side of that range have less trouble controlling their blood glucose levels and maintaining lower levels of blood fats. Your registered dietitian may recommend more.

We wouldnt argue as long as you can maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels while not increasing the level of triglyceride, a blood fat.

Considering the glycemic index The various carbohydrate sources differ in the degree to which they raise the blood glucose. This difference is called the glycemic index (GI) , and it refers to the glucose-raising power of a food compared with white bread.

24 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes In general, choose foods with a lower glycemic index in order to keep the rise in blood glucose to a minimum. Predicting the glycemic index of a mixed meal (one that contains an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert) is nearly impossible, but you can make some simple substitutions to lower the glycemic index of your diet, as shown in Table 2-1.

Table 2-1 Simple Diet Substitutions to Lower GI High GI foods Low GI foods Whole meal or white bread Whole-grain bread Processed breakfast cereal Unrefined cereals like oats or processed low-GI cereals Plain cookies and crackers Cookies made with dried fruits or whole grains like oats Cakes and muffins Cakes and muffins made with fruits, oats, and whole grains Tropical fruits like bananas Temperate-climate fruits like apples and plums Potatoes Pasta or legumes Rice Basmati or other low-GI rice Many of these lower glycemic index foods contain a lot of fiber. Fiber is a carbohydrate that cant be broken down by digestive enzymes, so it doesnt raise blood glucose and adds no calories. Fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes while it improves bowel function, preventing constipation. For the person who has diabetes already, fiber reduces blood glucose levels. The riper the fruit, the higher the GI.

If a food has a lot of fiber in it (more than 5 grams per serving), you can subtract the grams of fiber from the grams of carbohydrates in that food in determining the calories from carbohydrate.

The best sources of fiber are fruits, whole grains, and vegetables, especially the legumes. Animal food sources dont provide fiber. It is recommended that you consume 25 grams of fiber daily. Table 2-2 shows some sources of larger amounts of fiber.

Table 2-2 Sources of Fiber Food, Amount Fiber (gm) Kcalories Navy beans, cooked, 12 cup 9.5 128 Bran cereal, 12 cup 8.8 78 Kidney beans, 12 cup 8.2 109 Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 25 Food, Amount Fiber (gm) Kcalories Split peas, cooked, 12 cup 8.1 116 Lentils, cooked 12 cup 7.8 115 Black beans, cooked, 12 cup 7.5 114 Whole-wheat English muffin 4.4 134 Pear, raw, smal 4.3 81 Apple, with skin, 1 medium 3.3 72 Fiber can be present in two forms:  Insoluble: It doesnt dissolve in water but stays in the intestine as rough-age, which helps to prevent constipation; for example, fiber found in whole-grain breads and cereals, and the skin of fruits and vegetables.

Soluble: It dissolves in water and enters the blood, where it helps lower glucose and cholesterol; for example, fiber found in barley, brown rice, and beans, as well as vegetables and fruits.

You can take a spoonful of sugar in your coffee and have a little sugar in your food, but be aware of the number of calories you are adding with no micronutrients (vitamins and minerals present in tiny amounts but essential). See Monitoring Your Micronutrients, later in this chapter, for more info.

Choosing sugar substitutes Although people with diabetes are allowed to have some sugar in their diet, sugar is more appropriate for a diabetic who is at normal weight than an obese diabetic. Preventing obesity may be a matter of avoiding as little as 50 extra calories a day. If this can be accomplished by using artificial sweeteners, which provide sweetening power but no calories, so much the better.

Some of the recipes in this book call for 14 cup or more of sugar. These are perfect opportunities to use a sugar substitute and significantly lower the calories from sugar.

Kilocalorie-containing sweeteners Several sugars besides sucrose (table sugar) are present in food. These sugars have different properties than glucose, are taken up differently from the intestine, and raise the blood level at a slower rate or not at all if theyre not ultimately converted into glucose. They sometimes cause diarrhea.

Although these kilocalorie-containing sweeteners are sweeter than sugar and you use them in smaller amounts, they do have calories that you must count in your daily intake.

26 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes The following sweeteners contain kilocalories but act differently in the body than sucrose:  Fructose, found in fruits and berries: Fructose is sweeter than table sugar and is absorbed more slowly than glucose, so it raises the glucose level more slowly. When it enters the bloodstream, it is taken up by the liver, where it is converted to glucose.

Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries: Xylitol is also sweeter than table sugar and has fewer kilocalories per gram. It is absorbed more slowly than sugar. When used in gum, for example, it reduces the occurrence of dental caries (tooth decay).

Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants: Sorbitol and mannitol are half as sweet as table sugar and have little effect on blood glucose. They change to fructose in the body.

Sweeteners without calories This group of non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners (with the exception of Stevia, which comes from a plant) is much sweeter than table sugar and contains no calories at all. Much less of these sweeteners will provide the same level of sweetness as a larger amount of sugar. However, the taste of some of them may seem a little off compared to sugar or honey. They include the following:  Saccharin: This has 300 to 400 times the sweetening power of sugar, and it is heat stable so it can be used in baking and cooking. Brand names for saccharin are Sucaryl, SugarTwin, and SweetN Low.

Aspartame: This is more expensive than saccharin, but people often prefer its taste. It is 150 to 200 times as sweet as sugar. Equal and Sweetmate are two of the brands. It loses its sweetening power when heated, so it cant be used if food has to be cooked for longer than 20 minutes.

Acesulfame-K: This is 200 times sweeter than sugar and is heat stable, so it is used in baking and cooking.

Stevia: This is 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It was approved by the FDA in 2008 and marketed as Rebiana in Coca-Cola.

Sucralose: This sweetener, which is made from sugar, is 600 times sweeter than its parent, sucrose. The brand name is Splenda. It remains stable when heated and has become a favorite sweetener in the food industry. Because foods dont bake the same when made with Splenda, a combination of Splenda and sugar called Pure Magic is sold to reduce calories while providing the baking characteristics of sugar.

Appendix C shows the amount of these various sweeteners that will give the sweetening power of a measured amount of sucrose (table sugar). Feel free to Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 27 substitute calorie-free sweeteners whenever sugar is called for. The calories you save could make a big difference in your diabetes.

Contrary to opinions that you may hear or read, there is no scientific evidence that these sweeteners are associated with a higher incidence of cancer.

Getting Enough Protein (Not Just from Meat) Most Americans are already eating more than the recommended daily intake of protein. Protein comes from meat, fish, poultry, milk, and cheese. It can also be found in beans, peas, and lentils, which we mention in the carbohydrate discussion in the preceding section. Meat sources of protein can be low or very high in fat, depending on the source. Because people with diabetes should be trying to keep the fat content of their diets fairly low, lowfat sources of protein, such as skinless white meat chicken or turkey, flounder or halibut, and fat-free cheese are preferred. Beans, peas, and lentils, which can be very good sources of protein, dont contain fat but do contain carbohydrate.

How much protein should you eat? We recommend that 40 percent of your calories should be carbohydrate, and in the next section, we suggest that you limit your fat intake to 30 percent of your calories. The remaining 30 percent is protein.

Protein doesnt cause an immediate rise in blood glucose, but it can raise glucose levels several hours later, after your liver processes the protein and converts some of it into glucose. Therefore, protein isnt a good choice if you want to treat low blood glucose, but a snack containing protein at bedtime may help prevent low blood glucose during the night.

Focusing on Fat Fat comes in many different forms. The one everyone talks about is cholesterol, the type found in the yolk of an egg. However, most of the fat that people eat comes in a chemical form known as triglyceride. This term refers to the chemistry of the fat, and we dont have to get into the details of it for you to understand how to handle fat in your diet. In the following sections, we start with a discussion of cholesterol and then turn to other forms of fat.

28 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Zeroing in on cholesterol These days, just about everyone knows his or her cholesterol level. You usually find out your total cholesterol level, a combination of so-called good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. If your total is high, much of that cholesterol may be the good kind  HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. If youre interested in knowing the balance between good and bad cholesterol in your body, talk with your medical practitioner, who may recommend a lipid panel that delivers more details.

The Framingham Study, an ongoing study of the health of the citizens of Framingham, Massachusetts, has shown that the total cholesterol amount divided by the good cholesterol figure gives a number that is a reasonable measure of the risk of a heart attack. People who had results that were less than 4.5 were at lower risk of heart attacks, while those with results of more that 4.5 were at higher risk. The risk increases as the number rises.

More recently, another component of the total cholesterol in your blood, the so-called bad cholesterol or LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) has been found to have a very important role in causing heart attacks. For people at high risk of a heart attack, the recommended level for LDL used to be less than 100 mg/dl but has recently been lowered to less than 70 mg/dl.

Most foods dont contain much cholesterol  with the exception of eggs. The daily recommendation for cholesterol is less than 300 milligrams, and one egg almost reaches that level. Some doctors say that eating an egg two or three times a week wont hurt you, but this isnt true if you have diabetes. Avoid eggs and foods such as organ meats that are high in cholesterol, or use egg substitutes instead.

Taking a look at other types of fat Although cholesterol gets all the press, most of the fat you eat is in the form of triglyceride, the fat you see on fatty meats, contained in whole-fat dairy products, and in many processed foods. There are several forms of triglyceride:  Saturated fat is the kind of fat that comes from animal sources like that big piece of rib-eye steak you ate the other night. Butter, bacon, cream, and cream cheese are other examples. Saturated fat increases your bad cholesterol levels and should be avoided.

Trans fats were invented by food manufacturers to replace butter, which is more expensive. Unfortunately trans fats, which are currently listed as partially hydrogenated oil on food labels, may be worse than saturated fat in causing coronary heart disease. Theyre found in margarine, cake mixes, dried soup mixes, many fast foods, and many frozen Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 29 foods, doughnuts, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals, candies, and whipped toppings. Keep them out of your diet by reading food labels, which must list them.

Unsaturated fats come from vegetable sources such as olive oil and canola oil. There are two forms of unsaturated fats:  Monounsaturated fats, which dont raise cholesterol in the blood.

Olive oil, canola oil, and avocado are some examples. The oil in nuts is also monounsaturated.

Polyunsaturated fats, which dont raise cholesterol but can lower good or HDL cholesterol. Corn oil, mayonnaise, and some margarines have this form of fat.

Curbing your fat intake Fat has concentrated calories, so dont eat too much fat in your diet.

However, monounsaturated fats seem to protect against heart disease. The increased intake of olive oil by people living around the Mediterranean Sea may be the reason for their lower incidence of heart disease.

Although vegetable sources of fat are generally better than animal sources, the exceptions are palm oil and coconut oil, which are highly saturated fats.

Demystifying fatspeak If youre concerned about the amount of fat in  Low saturated fat: 1 gram or less of satu-your diet (and of course you are), you should rated fat and no more than 15 percent of understand the government definitions of words calories from saturated fat describing the amounts of fat in various foods.

Cholesterol-free: Less than 2 mil igrams of Here are the definitions: cholesterol per serving or 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving  Fat-free: Less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving  Low cholesterol: Less than 20 mil igrams of cholesterol or less than 2 grams of satu-  Lowfat: Less than 3 grams of fat per serving rated fat per serving  Reduced fat: 25 percent less fat when com- pared with a similar food  Reduced cholesterol: At least 25 percent less cholesterol compared to a similar food  Lean meat: Less than 10 grams of fat, less and 2 grams or less of saturated fat than 4 grams of saturated fat, and less than 95 mil igrams of cholesterol per serving 30 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Heres my bottom line recommendation: No more than 30 percent of your kilocalories should come from fat, and of that, no more than a third should come from saturated fats. For a person eating 1,500 kilocalories a day, this recommendation would mean 450 kilocalories from fat, and 150 of those kilocalories from saturated fat.

Use vegetable oils, preferably canola oil and olive oil, as your primary sources of fat, because these lower cholesterol.

Choose fish or poultry as your source of protein in order to avoid consuming too much fat along with your protein. If you remove the skin from chicken, youll get little fat. Fish actually has certain fatty acids that lower cholesterol.

Theres a little danger in eating too much salmon, however. One man ate so many salmon croquettes, salmon steaks, and salmon salads that he had to fight the urge to go north and spawn.

Figuring Out Your Diet After you know how much to eat of each energy source (carbohydrate, fat, and protein), how do you translate this into actual foods? You can use two basic approaches and a new, even simpler technique.

Using the food guide pyramid The federal government, with the assistance of many experts, has come up with a simple way for you to eat a good, balanced diet: the food guide pyramid. This pyramid was recently completely revised so that you can be more specific about food choices and portions depending on your specific needs.

For complete information about the new pyramid and how you can use it to your best advantage, be sure to check out www.mypyramid.gov. After you enter some basic information about yourself, using the sites interactive tool, you can get specific portion sizes for each food group. This Web site is full of great nutritional information and tips on how to adapt the pyramids recommendations to your lifestyle.

The food guide pyramid is probably a good tool for a person with type 2 diabetes who doesnt tend to gain weight, but the person with type 1 diabetes or the person who is obese with type 2 diabetes needs to know the specific number of calories and particularly the carbohydrate calories that he or she is eating. Thats the reason I provide information about carbohydrate counting as well as a new calculation method in the next sections.

Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 31 Working with diabetic exchanges Diabetic exchanges were first developed by the American Diabetes Association and the U.S. Public Health Service in the 1950s. They were revised in 1976, 1986, and 1995, but dietitians, in general, ignore it in advising patients with diabetes. We believe it is time to drop it from the teaching of good food practices in diabetes. If you have a previous version of this book, please cross it out! Carbohydrate counting, in the next section, is a much simpler and more useful approach.

Counting carbohydrates People with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin may find the technique of counting carbohydrates to be the easiest for them.

You still need to know how much carbohydrate you should eat in a given day.

You divide the total into the meals and snacks that you eat and then, with the help of your doctor or certified diabetes educator, you determine your short-acting insulin needs based upon that amount of carbohydrates and the blood glucose that you measure before that meal.

For example, suppose that a person with diabetes is about to have a breakfast containing 60 grams of carbohydrate. He has found that each unit of lispro insulin controls about 20 grams of carbohydrate intake in his body.

Figuring the proper amount of short-acting insulin can be accomplished by a process of trial and error: knowing the amount of carbohydrate intake and determining how many units are needed to keep the blood glucose level about the same after eating the carbohydrate as it was before. (The number of carbohydrate grams that each unit of insulin can control differs for each individual, and another person might control only 15 grams per unit.) In this example, the persons measured blood glucose is 150 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter). This result is about 50 mg/dl higher than he wants it to be. He knows that he can lower his blood glucose by 50 mg/dl for every unit of insulin he takes. Therefore, he needs 3 units of lispro for the carbohydrate intake and 1 unit for the elevated blood glucose for a total of 4 units. For more information on lispro, other types of insulin, and figuring out insulin sensitivity, see Dr. Rubins book Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley).

He has a morning that is more active than he expected. When lunchtime comes, his blood glucose is down to 60 mg/dl. Hes about to eat a lunch containing 75 grams of carbohydrate. He takes 4 units of lispro for the food but reduces it by 1 unit to a total of 3 units because his blood glucose is low.

Contents 32 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes How What You Eat Affects At dinner, he is eating 45 grams of carbohydrate. His blood glucose is 115 mg/ Your Diabetes 21 dl. He takes 2 units of lispro for the food intake and needs no change for the blood glucose, so he takes only 2 units.

To be a successful carbohydrate counter, you must Considering a Vegetarian Diet 22  Have an accurate knowledge of the grams of carbohydrate in the food you are about to eat and how many units of insulin you need for a given number of grams of carbohydrate.

Measure your blood glucose and know how your body responds to each Calculating Carbohydrates  unit of insulin.

Precursors of Glucose 23 You can make this calculation a little easier by using constant carbohydrates, which means that you try to choose carbohydrates so that you are eating about the same amount at every meal and snack. This approach makes determining proper amounts of insulin less tricky; just add or subtract units based upon your blood glucose level before that meal. A few sessions with your Getting Enough Protein physician or a certified diabetes educator can help you feel more comfort-able about counting carbohydrates.

(Not Just from Meat)27 Using a simple calculation Focusing on Fat 27 For patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take a shot of rapid-acting insulin before meals and a shot of long-acting insulin once a day, this may be the easiest way to go. And it is just as effective as carbohydrate counting in lowering the hemoglobin A1c.

Figuring Out Your Diet 30 The method is based on a study published in Diabetes Care in July 2008. The authors compared their method with a group that did traditional carbohydrate counting and found no difference. Both techniques lowered the hemo- Monitoring Your Micronutrients 33 globin A1c into the normal range.

The targets were a fasting blood glucose of less than 95 mg/dl, blood glucose before lunch and dinner of less than 100 mg/dl, and bedtime glucose of less than 130 mg/dl.

Recognizing the Importance of Timing The initial dose of the long-acting insulin (in this case, insulin glargine) was of Food and Medication 34 determined by adding all the insulin taken in a day before the study began.

The dose was then started at 50 percent of the previous total daily insulin.

The dose was adjusted by taking the mean of the previous three days fasting glucose levels. The adjustment was then made as follows: If the mean of the last three-day fasting glucose was  Greater than 180 mg/dl: Increase 8 units  140 to 180 mg/dl: Increase 6 units Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 33  120 to 139 mg/dl: Increase 4 units  95 to 119 mg/dl: Increase 2 units  70 to 94 mg/dl: No change  Less than 70 mg/dl: Decrease by the same units as the previous increase or up to 10 percent of the previous dose The dose of the rapid-acting insulin before meals (in this case insulin glulisine) at first totaled the other 50 percent of the pre-study daily insulin. It was divided into 50 percent for the meal with the most carbohydrate, 33 percent for the middle meal, and 17 percent for the meal with the least carbohydrate.

Table 2-3 shows the adjustments made to the rapid-acting insulin based on the pattern of the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and bedtime glucose patterns of the previous week.

Table 2-3 Adjustment of Rapid-Acting Insulin Mealtime and Pattern of mealtime blood Pattern of mealtime bedtime dose glucose below target blood glucose above target Less than or equal to Decrease by 1 unit Increase by 1 unit 10 units 11 to 19 units Decrease by 2 units Increase by 2 units 20 units or greater Decrease by 3 units Increase by 3 units Try this system for yourself. Its easy and it works.

Monitoring Your Micronutrients Food contains a lot more than just carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Most of the other components are micronutrients (present in tiny or micro quantities), which are essential for maintaining the health of human beings. Examples of micronutrients include vitamins (such as vitamin C and vitamin K) and minerals (such as calcium, magnesium, and iron). Most micronutrients are needed in such small amounts that its extremely unlikely that you would ever suffer a deficiency of them. A person who eats a balanced diet by using the pyramid technique or the exchange technique doesnt have to worry about getting sufficient quantities of micronutrients  with a few exceptions, which follow:  Adults need to be sure to take in at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium each day. If youre a young person still growing, pregnant, or elderly, you need 1,500 milligrams daily. The best food sources of calcium are 34 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes plain nonfat yogurt, fat-free or lowfat milk, fortified ready-to-eat cereals, and calcium-fortified soy beverages.

Some menstruating women lose more iron than their bodies can spare and need to take iron supplements. The best sources of iron are iron-rich plant foods like spinach and lowfat meats.

You probably take in 20 to 40 times more salt (sodium) than you need and are better off leaving added salt out of your diet.

You should increase your uptake of potassium to help lower blood pressure. The best sources are leafy green vegetables, fruit from vines, and root vegetables. For more information on micronutrients, check out Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

Recognizing the Importance of Timing of Food and Medication If you take insulin, the peak of your insulin activity should correspond with the greatest availability of glucose in your blood. To accomplish this, you need to know the time when your insulin is most active, how long it lasts, and when it is no longer active.

Regular insulin, which has been around for decades, takes 30 minutes to start to lower the glucose level, peaks at three hours, and is gone by six to eight hours. This insulin is used before meals to keep glucose low until the next meal. The problem with regular insulin has always been that you have to take it 30 minutes before you eat or run the risk of becoming hypoglycemic at first, and hyperglycemic later when the insulin is no longer around but your food is providing glucose.

Rapid-acting lispro insulin and insulin glulisine are the newest preparations and the shortest acting. They begin to lower the glucose level within five minutes after administration, peak at about one hour, and are no longer active by about three hours. These insulins are a great advance because they free the person with diabetes to take a shot only when he or she eats. Because their activity begins and ends so quickly, they dont cause hypoglycemia as often as the older preparation.

Given a choice, because of its rapid onset and fall-off in activity, I recommend either lispro or glulisine as the short-acting insulins of choice for people with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who take insulin.

Chapter 2: How What You Eat Affects Your Diabetes 35 If youre going out to eat, you rarely know when the food will be served.

Using rapid-acting insulins, you can measure your blood glucose when the food arrives and take an immediate shot. These preparations really free you to take insulin when you need it. They add a level of flexibility to your schedule that didnt exist before.

If you take regular insulin, keep to a more regular schedule of eating. In addition to short-acting insulin, if you have type 1 diabetes, or in some instances type 2 diabetes, you need to take a longer-acting preparation. The reason is to ensure that some insulin is always circulating to keep your bodys metabolism running smoothly. Insulin glargine and insulin detemir are preparations that have no peak of activity but are available for 24 hours. You take one shot daily at bedtime, and they cover your needs for insulin except when large amounts of glucose enter your blood after meals. That is what rapid-acting insulins are for.

Each person responds in his or her own way to different preparations of insulin. You need to test your blood glucose to determine your individual response.

An additional factor affecting the onset of insulin is the location of the injection. Because your abdominal muscles are usually at rest, injection of insulin into the abdomen results in more consistent blood glucose levels. If you use the arms or legs, the insulin will be taken up faster or slower, depending on whether you exercise or not. Be sure to rotate sites.

The depth of the injection also affects the onset of activity of the insulin. A deeper injection results in a faster onset of action. If you use the same length needle and insert it to its maximum length each time, youll ensure more uniform activity.

You can see from the discussion in this section that a great deal of variation is possible in the taking of an insulin shot. Its no wonder that people who must inject insulin tend to have many more ups and downs in their blood glucose. But with proper education, these variations can be reduced.

If you take oral medication, in particular the sulfonylurea drugs like micronase and glucotrol, the timing of food in relation to the taking of your medication must also be considered. For a complete explanation of this balance between food and medication, see Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition .

36 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Contents Planning Meals for Chapter 3 Your Weight Goal 37 Planning Meals for Figuring Out How Many Calories You Need 38 Your Weight Goal In This Chapter Losing Weight Rapidly  Deciding how many calories to eat  Shedding weight quickly at 1,200 kilocalories at 1,200 Kilocalories 40  Dropping weight more slowly at 1,500 kilocalories  Staying at your current weight with 1,800 kilocalories  Looking at other diets Losing Weight More Slowly at 1,500 Kilocalories 41 You can eat wisely, get all the nutrients you need, and continue to eat great food, but you do have to limit your portions. In this chapter, we show you how to plan three different daily levels of kilocalories (the proper Maintaining Your Weight term for what most people call calories). You can lose weight rapidly, lose more slowly, or maintain your weight.

at 1,800 Kilocalories 42 We prefer the slower approach to losing weight. With this method, youll probably feel less hungry, and cutting back a few hundred kilocalories a day doesnt cause a major upheaval in daily life. Also, maintaining a weight loss may be easier if you lose the weight slowly.

Checking Out Other Diets 43 Exercise can help speed up weight loss or permit you to eat more and still lose weight. Twenty minutes of walking burns up 100 kilocalories, and 30 minutes of walking burns up 150 kilocalories. Walk for 30 minutes a day, and you lose about 13 of a pound per week (7 times 150 equals 1,050 kilocalories divided into 3,500)  without reducing your calories. That activity amounts to an annual weight loss of 17 pounds in a year. Who says you cant lose weight by exercising but not dieting?

38 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Considering the calories youre storing Patients often worry that theyre going to feel 100 kilocalories to walk 20 minutes at 4 miles an hungry if they take in fewer calories than they hour. So a walk of 113 miles (one-third of 4 miles) need. Does a bear feel hungry as it lives off its burns 100 kilocalories. Your stored energy  fat al winter long? No, it sleeps.

87,500 kilocalories  would take you about One of our favorite tasks is to point out how 1,100 miles (87,500 divided by 100 times 113)!

many calories of energy are stored in the We certainly dont suggest that you stop eating body of an overweight or obese person. Each and fast for any length of time in order to lose pound of fat contains 3,500 kilocalories. If weight, but recognize that your stored energy, youre 25 pounds overweight, you have 87,500 in the form of fat, wil provide al the calories kilocalories (25 times 3,500) of stored energy necessary to continue your daily activities within your body. We can give you an idea of what out fatigue and often without hunger.

you could do with that much energy. You need Figuring Out How Many Calories You Need Before planning a nutritional program, you need to know how much you need to eat on a daily basis to maintain your current weight. Then you can figure how rapidly a deficit of calories will get you to your goal.

Finding your ideal weight range The ideal weight for your height is a range and not a single weight at each height, but we use numbers that give a weight in the middle of that range.

Because people have different amounts of muscle and different size frames, youre considered normal if your weight is plus or minus 10 percent of this number. For example, a person who is calculated to have an ideal weight of 150 pounds is considered normal at a weight of 135 (150 minus 10 percent) to 165 (150 plus 10 percent) pounds.

Because no two people, even twins, are totally alike in all aspects of their lives, we can only approximate your ideal weight and the number of calories you need to maintain that weight. Youll test the correctness of the approximation by adding or subtracting calories. If your daily caloric needs are 2,000 kilocalories and you find yourself putting on weight, try reducing your intake by 100 kilocalories and see whether you maintain your weight on fewer kilocalories.

Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal 39 If youre a male, your approximate ideal weight is 106 pounds for 5 feet of height plus 6 pounds for each inch over 5 feet. If youre a female, your ideal weight is 100 pounds for 5 feet plus 5 pounds for each inch over 5 feet tall. For example, a 5-foot-4-inch male should weigh 130 pounds while the same height female should weigh 120 pounds. Your ideal weight range is then plus or minus 10 percent. The male could weigh 117 to 143 pounds and the female 108 to 132 pounds.

Now you know your ideal weight for your height. What a surprise! Yes, we know. You have big bones, but bear with us. It is amazing how often we have seen big bones melt away as weight is lost.

Determining your caloric needs After you know about how much you should weigh, figure out how many calories you need to maintain your ideal weight. Start by multiplying your ideal weight by ten. For example, if youre a male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, your ideal weight is 142 pounds. Your daily kilocalorie allowance is about 1,400. But this number is ideal only if you dont take a breath or have a heartbeat. It is considered your basal caloric need. You must increase your calorie intake depending upon the amount of physical activity you do each day. Table 3-1 shows this graduated increase.

Table 3-1 Kilocalories Needed Based on Activity Level Level of Activity Kilocalories Added 56 Male Sedentary 10% more than basal 1,540 kilocalories Moderate 20% more than basal 1,680 kilocalories Very active 40%+ more than basal 1,960+ kilocalories The Very active line displays a plus sign because some people doing hard manual labor need so many extra calories that they should not be held to only 40 percent more than their basal calorie intake. This requirement becomes clear as the person gains or loses weight on his or her food plan.

You gain weight when your daily intake of kilocalories exceeds your daily needs. Each pound of fat has 3,500 kilocalories, so when the excess has reached that number of calories, you are a pound heavier. On the other hand, you lose weight when your daily expenditure of calories exceeds your daily intake. You lose a pound of fat each time you burn up 3,500 kilocalories more than you take in, whether you do it by burning an extra 100 kilocalories per day for 35 days or an extra 500 kilocalories per day for 7 days.

Now you can create a nutritional program and fill in the blanks with carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and real foods.

40 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Losing Weight Rapidly at 1,200 Kilocalories If youre a moderately active male, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, you need 1,680 or approximately 1,700 kilocalories daily to maintain your weight. (Refer to Table 3-2.) If you eat only 1,200 kilocalories daily, youll have a daily deficit of approximately 500 kilocalories. By dividing the kilocalories in a pound of fat (3,500) by 500, you can see that youll lose 1 pound per week (3,500 divided by 500 is 7, so the loss will take 7 days).

In Chapter 3, you find that you want to eat 40 percent of your calories as carbohydrate, 30 percent as protein, and 30 percent as fat. Multiplying 1,200 kilocalories by those percentages, a 1,200 kilocalorie diet would provide 480 kilocalories of carbohydrate, 360 kilocalories of protein, and 360 kilocalories of fat. Because there are 4 kilocalories of energy in each gram of carbohydrate and protein, dividing the kilocalories by 4, you can eat 120 grams of carbohydrate and 90 grams of protein. Because there are 9 kilocalories in each gram of fat, you can eat 40 grams of fat.

You can create your diet using recipes where you know the grams of carbohydrate, such as the ones in this book. Table 3-2 shows you such a diet.

Table 3-2 A 1,200-Kilocalorie Diet Meal Recipe Carbs (g) Protein Fat (g) (g) Breakfast Whole-Wheat Waffles 30 9 1 (Chapter 6) Lunch Goat-Cheese-Stuffed 17 21 30 Zucchini (Chapter 11) Dinner Horseradish-Crusted 73 58 9 Cod (Chapter 12) Total 120 88 40 All we did in making up this diet was to make sure the carbohydrate total came to about 120 grams. It was purely accidental that the grams of protein and fat worked out so well. If they had not, my next days diet would have been more of what was missing and less of what was present in too large an amount.

You can see how easy it is to create a diet when the grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate are listed for you as they are in this book. It is very difficult Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal 41 to do the same thing when you go to a restaurant and have no idea of the contents of the food. At the grocery store, the food label gives you the breakdown that you need. That is why it is so important to check the food labels, as explained in Chapter 5, to find out how much carbohydrate, protein, and fat the food actually contains.

The portions on all food labels are based on a 2,000-kilocalorie diet. Not one of the diets in this chapter allows you to eat that many calories. Such a portion may be much too large for a person on a 1,200-kilocalorie diet.

Losing Weight More Slowly at 1,500 Kilocalories The smaller the deficit of calories between what you need and what you eat, the more slowly youll lose weight. If your daily needs are 1,700 kilocalories and you eat 1,500, youll be missing 200 kilocalories each day. Because a pound of fat is 3,500 kilocalories, youll lose a pound in about 17 days (3,500 divided by 200). Youll lose almost 2 pounds a month, or 24 pounds in a year.

You can accomplish this loss by reducing your daily intake by only the equivalent of a piece of bread and two teaspoons of margarine. Put that way, losing the weight doesnt seem difficult at all.

Below we use the recipes in this book to make up a 1,500-kilocalorie diet. In this plan, youre eating 600 kilocalories of carbohydrate or 150 grams, 450 kilocalories of protein or 112 grams, and 450 kilocalories of fat or 50 grams.

Table 3-3 A 1,500-Kilocalorie Diet Meal Recipe Carbs (g) Protein (g) Fat (g) Breakfast Blueberry and Almond 38 10 2 Pancakes (Chapter 6) Lunch Indian-Inspired Lamb 23 23 14 and Legume Chile (Chapter 8) Dinner Pail ard of Chicken 24 51 33 Breast with Fennel and Parmigiano (Chapter 13) Total 85 84 49 You notice that this plan is 65 grams low on carbohydrate, 28 grams low on protein, and 1 gram low on fat. This allows you to have some fruit with the 42 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes meal or snacks in between to make up the difference. An apple, half banana, and 12 cherries will provide 45 grams of carbohydrate because each is 15 grams. A tablespoon of cashews and 6 almonds will provide 10 grams of unsaturated fat. Two ounces of ricotta cheese with 5 grams of fat per ounce will provide 10 grams of fat.

As you create your meals, youll be amazed at how small the portions really are. Four ounces of lean meat isnt much compared to what most people are used to eating at home or in restaurants. Eating proper portions is very important because it will ultimately make the difference between weight gain and weight maintenance or loss. Portion size may also be the difference between controlling your blood glucose and not controlling it. Check out Chapter 1 for more about portion sizes.

Think of the money you will save if  each time you go to a restaurant  your knowledge of portion sizes allows you to take home half of your meal to eat another day.

Maintaining Your Weight at 1,800 Kilocalories Suppose that you have finally reached a weight (not necessarily your ideal weight that we calculate in the section Figuring Your Daily Caloric Needs) that allows your blood glucose levels to remain between 80 and 140 mg/dl all the time. Now, you want to maintain that weight. You want to eat about 1,800 kilocalories, up another 300 from the previous diet in this chapter. Compared to the 1,200-kilocalorie diet, this may seem like a lot of food.

This plan provides 180 grams of carbohydrate, 135 grams of protein, and 60 grams of fat, maintaining the 40:30:30 division of calories. You can use the recipes to create this diet as well, as shown in Table 3-4.

Exercise for prevention A study published in the June 2007 edition of study concluded that 30 minutes per day of Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism moderate- or high-level physical activity can looked at numerous studies of the effect of effectively and safely prevent type 2 diabetes exercise on the occurrence of diabetes. The in al populations.

You can make up the difference with fruits, crackers, and other sources of carbohydrate and protein but not fat.

If you have type 2 diabetes, this plan is an excellent way for you to eat the right amount of calories in the right ratios of energy sources. If you have type 1 diabetes, or you have type 2 and take insulin, you need to know the grams of carbohydrate in each meal in order to determine your insulin needs for that meal.

Checking Out Other Diets If you go to the diet section of any large bookstore, youll be overwhelmed by the choices. Youll find diets that recommend protein and no carbohydrate, carbohydrate and no protein, one type of carbohydrate and not another, all rice, all grapefruit, and on and on. How is it possible for all these diets, many of which are exactly the opposite of others on the same shelf, to actually work for you? The answer is they do and they dont. If you follow any diet closely, youll lose weight. But will the weight stay off? That is the most difficult part (as were sure you know).

In this section we tell you about the most popular diets presently recommended by this or that brilliant scientist. Which one do we recommend?

44 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes None of them and all of them. If you find that you can get started losing weight successfully with one of these programs, go ahead and do it, but remember that in the end you want to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat and protein and uses carbohydrates that emphasize whole grains and fiber.

And remember that you wont be successful without exercise.

Reduction of any source of calories  by reduction of carbohydrates, protein, or fat  has been shown to be equally effective.

The low carbohydrate group These diets are based on the claim that carbohydrates promote hunger. By reducing or eliminating them, you lose your hunger as you lose your weight.

The first of them, the Atkins Diet, promotes any kind of protein, including protein high in fat. Naturally, other diets were developed promoting very little carbohydrate but less fatty protein. Here are your choices:  Atkins Diet: This plan allows any quantity of meats, shellfish, eggs, and cheese but doesnt permit high-carbohydrate foods like fruits, starchy vegetables, and pasta. Small quantities of the forbidden foods are added in later. The program does recommend exercise but doesnt suggest changes in your eating behavior.

South Beach Diet: This diet restricts carbohydrates while the recommended proteins are low in fat, unlike the Atkins Diet. Daily exercise is an important component, but the plan doesnt suggest any changes in eating behavior. Over time some carbohydrate is reintroduced into the diet.

Ultimate Weight Solution: This plan recommends a lot of protein, which naturally results in a reduction in carbohydrate. This program also advises you not to eat foods that are high in fat. Support groups in which you learn how to modify your eating behaviors are very important, and youre supposed to stay in these groups throughout your life.

The plan also emphasizes regular exercise, such as walking.

Zone Diet: In this diet, you have to balance your food intake into exact amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Youre not permitted to eat high-carbohydrate and high-fat food. Regular exercise is recommended, but the plan doesnt suggest changes in your eating behavior. You have to continue with this balance throughout life to maintain your weight loss.

The portion control group These diets recognize that its not what you eat but how much you eat that determines your weight. They generally follow the recommendations of the government food guidelines. Here are some examples of portion control diets: Chapter 3: Planning Meals for Your Weight Goal 45  DASH Diet: Here, the emphasis is on grains, fruits, and vegetables and restricting the amounts of fat. A further modification for those with high blood pressure recommends very little salt. Animal protein, such as meat, fish, and poultry, is limited. An exercise program is suggested but not defined. This diet suggests changes in eating behavior. It is a diet for life (and a very good one).

Jenny Craig: This diet is balanced in terms of carbohydrates, protein, and fat but pushes its own food products, which can get expensive. You are directed to exercise by the counselor, who is an important (and costly) part of the program as well. To stay on this diet, you need their products lifelong.

Weight Watchers: This plan uses a point system in which foods are given points according to the amount of fat, fiber, and calories in them.

To get to and maintain a certain weight, youre given a daily number of points. As long as you stay within these points, youll be successful.

Therefore, foods that have large amounts of calories will use up your daily points quickly. The program suggests exercise and changes in your lifestyle.

A diet that emphasizes weight training The Abs Diet is similar to the diets that recommend a balanced approach to eating, with carbohydrates that arent refined and dairy and meat that are low in fat as the most suggested foods. However, the major emphasis in this diet is on a program called Total Body Strength Training Workout to build up the muscles. Changes in eating behavior arent a large part of the program. To maintain weight loss, you must eat and exercise as the diet prescribes for your entire life.

More extreme diets These diets require a level of participation that may be difficult for people who have a life. You really need to give your time and energy to staying on the diet. If you go away for a few weeks and stay within their program, youll have some short-term success. But after you return home, sticking to the program gets difficult. Here are the two major programs currently available:  Dean Ornish Program: This plan allows fruits, vegetables, and whole grains along with the leanest of meats and poultry. You cant eat processed foods or drink caffeine or alcohol, and you must avoid sugar, salt, and oil. Exercise is recommended as is help with eating behaviors.

Meetings are an important part of this program, which youre supposed to follow for life.

46 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes  Pritikin Eating Plan: Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are essential foods, and the diet allows almost no protein or fat. Exercise is a part of the program as is changing your lifestyle to promote better eating behaviors. Youre expected to follow this program for life.

With the exception of the DASH Diet, which is recommended by the U.S. government, none of the diets described in the preceding sections have long-term studies that show, convincingly, that theyre better than any other. Each one of them has anecdotal evidence, meaning that one or two or ten people tell you how great they did on this or that diet. But you never hear from those who didnt do so great.

Some parts of every ethnic diet fit well in a diabetic regimen. You can find recipes to prove this Making Simple Modifications 58 premise in Part II of this book. You can also use all kinds of tricks to substitute good-for-you ingredients for those that wont help your diabetes. Thats what this chapter is all about. Even foods that seemingly have no business on the plate of a diabetic can be enjoyed if eaten in small portions.

Taking Holiday Measures 59 We wish we could eliminate the word diet from the diabetic vocabulary. The word implies taking something away or having to suffer somehow in order to follow it. This is not the case at all. You can eat great food and enjoy the taste of every ethnic variety, provided you concentrate on the amount of food and its breakdown into the sources of energy, keeping fats and carbohydrates in control. Perhaps the phrase nutritional plan would be better than diet.

Stop dieting and start eating delicious foods. It may take a lot of willpower, but you can give up dieting if you try hard enough.

Following Your Eating Plan Creating an eating plan that provides the proper number of kilocalories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat (see Chapter 3) is particularly important when 48 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes you have diabetes. After you know how much of each you need, you can translate those numbers into recipes and pick out the food that is the delicious end point of all the calculating. Make sure that your choices come from a variety of foods rather than eating the same thing over and over. You will be much more likely to stay on your program if you arent bored with what you eat.

Before you cook, make sure that the recipes fit into your eating plan. If you have already eaten your carbohydrate portions for the day, make sure that the food youre about to eat has little carbohydrate in it. The same is true for protein and, of course, fat. If you think moderation as you make your meal plan, youll keep to the portions you need to eat and no more.

Seasonal foods should play a primary role in your eating plan for several reasons:  Seasonal foods are the freshest foods in the market.

They are the least expensive foods.

The recipes you can prepare with these fresh foods are some of the most delicious. The recipes in this book show the tremendous influence that fresh ingredients have had on the imaginations of the best chefs in the United States and Canada.

In addition, time is an important factor in your eating plan. You may not have a great deal of time to prepare your food, and some of the recipes in this book may take more time than you can spare. Choose the meals that fit into your schedule. But remember that after youve prepared a recipe a few times, preparation is much faster and easier. Consider the time you spend preparing delicious, healthy food as an investment in your well-being. Take the time to eat properly now so that later you wont have to give up your time being sick.

As a person with diabetes, especially if you have type 1 diabetes, you must figure the timing of your food in your eating plan. You need to eat when your medications will balance your carbohydrates. This process is much easier with the rapid-acting insulins, lispro and glulisine, but if youre still using regular insulin, youll have to eat about 30 minutes after you take your shot.

Another essential part of your planning is what to do when you feel hungry but shouldnt eat. You can prepare a low-calorie snack for such occasions, or you can provide yourself with some diversion, such as a hobby, a movie, or, best of all, some exercise. Examples of low-calorie snacks are baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, a piece of fruit, and lowfat pudding.

Your diabetes medication may require you to have three meals a day, but if not, having three meals is still important. This approach spreads calories Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 49 over the day and helps you avoid coming to a meal extremely hungry. Try not to skip breakfast, even though society doesnt encourage taking the time for this meal. Making your own lunch as often as possible gives you control over what you eat. The fast lunches served in restaurants may not provide the lowfat nutrition that you think youre getting. For example, salads are often covered with a lot of oil. It may be the right type of oil, but it still provides a lot of fat calories.

Eating the Best of Ethnic Cuisines If you become diabetic, you dont have to give up the kinds of food youve always eaten. You can eat the same foods but decrease the portions, particularly if youre obese. People in ethnic groups who are normal in weight are doing two things that you need to do as well: eating smaller portions and keeping physically fit with exercise. Every ethnic choice also has vegetarian foods, which will be mentioned as we describe the foods.

After you receive a diagnosis of diabetes, try to find a dietitian who treats many members of your ethnic group. This person will be best trained to show you how to keep eating what you love, while altering it slightly to fit your needs.

The alteration may be no greater than simply reducing the amount of food that you eat each day. Or it may involve changing ingredients so that a high-fat source of energy is replaced by a lowfat energy source with no loss in taste.

Valuing African-American food African-American food, sometimes called soul food, combines the food preferences and cooking methods of the African slaves with the available ingredients and available fuel found in the United States. Slow cooking with lots of vegetables and meats, eating lots of greens, combining fruits and meats in main dishes, and deep-frying meats and vegetables were cooking tradi-tions brought to the United States. At the time, their foods, which contained too much fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt, did not hurt the overworked and abused slaves because their daily energy needs were so great. Today, the more sedentary African-American population suffers from one of the highest incidences of obesity and diabetes, not to mention high blood pressure and the consequences of those diseases. As their energy needs fell, African Americans didnt reduce their calorie intake.

The term soul food also points to the central place of eating in the African-American population. In the slave quarters, the preparation and sharing of good food helped the slaves to maintain their humanity, helping those even 50 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes less fortunate than themselves, who might have had no food at all. Because they had no other material possessions, food became the one symbol of wealth that wasnt taken from them. It also served as the focus of the creativity and artistic expression of the female slave.

But people dont have to abandon soul food. African-American cooks at home and chefs in restaurants have learned to use all the healthful ingredients, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains, with much smaller amounts of fat, sugar, and salt. They use spices in place of salt in very creative ways to bring out the taste of their fresh ingredients. The meats are leaner, and they use egg whites instead of the whole egg. They also avoid deep-frying as much as possible.

A new book published in March 2009 called Vegan Soul Kitchen by Bryant Terry (Da Capo Press) shows that you can make great soul food without animal protein or dairy.

The psychological implications of food in the African-American population means that changing from less healthy to more healthy food requires a change in mindset. African-American cooks can be just as creative or even more so with healthful ingredients. The use of less fat, less salt, and less sugar is essential, but other ingredients have to take their place. Quantities of food must be modified, and this may be the most difficult change, given the importance of food both as a symbol of wealth and for sharing. People must eat fewer cakes, pies, and cookies and find ways to creatively prepare fruit to take the place of sweet baked goods.

Appreciating Chinese food When you think of Chinese food, you think rice. But China is such a huge place, and rice cant be grown everywhere. In the north, millet is used to make cereal. About 1500 BC, wheat was introduced from West Asia.

Vegetables such as soybeans and cucumbers were added to the rice, and occasionally a little bit of chicken or beef was added. Ginger became a favorite flavoring because it was so readily available.

The Thais gave chicken to China, and pork was already there, while Westerners brought sheep and cattle. The Chinese, mostly peasants, had little fuel and little cooking oil. Consequently, they learned to cut their food into very small pieces so it would cook rapidly, using little oil for their stir-frying.

Around 1000 AD, because Buddhists, who made up a large part of the population, wouldnt eat meat, tofu or bean curd was introduced. The Chinese also learned to make long noodles from wheat and rice.

Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 51 Chinese cuisine is generally healthful. It includes lots of vegetables, fruits, and seafood, while keeping sugar and desserts to a minimum. People with diabetes need to avoid eating too much rice. Chinese restaurants offer wonderful vegetable dishes, many with tofu as a protein source. You can go into any Chinese restaurant and find numerous dishes that have only vegetables with tofu as a protein source.

When you cook Chinese food, use as little sugar and fat as possible, and steer clear of making deep-fried dishes.

Welcoming French food French food is always associated with the term haute cuisine, which means fine food prepared by highly skilled chefs. This kind of cooking derives from Italy and was introduced to France by Catherine de Medici. The French added their own subtle techniques to the methods of the Italians from Florence, adopting their use of truffles and mushrooms and preparing lighter sauces.

The French gave the world the technique of serving a series of dishes, one after the other, instead of a large buffet where people helped themselves to everything at once.

France has several distinct culinary regions:  The north: Abundant forests provide game, and streams provide fish.

The central area: The red wines provide the basis for much of the cooking.

The south: Goose liver, truffles, and Roquefort cheese combine with Mediterranean olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes to produce the distinctive cuisine that is loved throughout the Western world, especially in its new lighter form.

You can go to Paris and find plenty of vegetarian restaurants. French chefs  some of the best in the world  are geniuses at using whatever ingredients are at hand to make delicious meals.

Enjoying Italian food Italian food reflects the history of Italy. Until 1870, Italy was divided into many different regions, with each one developing its own cuisine. Therefore, there is no one Italian food, but there are some common trends: 52 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes  The food of northern Italy features more wild game, such as deer and rabbits, along with some farm animals, such as beef, chickens, and goats. Seasonings include garlic, onions, rosemary, and bay leaf.

In the south, much closer to the sea, seafood received much more emphasis. Southerners also developed some of the famous cheeses like ricotta and pecorino. It was here where the Italian staple, the artichoke, was first discovered and cultivated.

The invasions of Arabs from North Africa in southern Italy around 800 AD brought some of the foods that are now most typically thought of as Italian, things like melons, dates, rice, and lemons, but their major contribution was pasta. The Spanish gave the tomato to Italy, but the Italians took it over and made it their own.

Today, northern Italian cooking emphasizes cream and meat sauces. Rice dishes like risotto and polenta made from yellow corn are enjoyed along with gnocchi, a dumpling contributed by Germany.

As you move south, the olive becomes part of many dishes, along with wine for cooking. In southern Italy, the tomato is the basis of most cooking, particularly its use in pasta dishes. The cheeses mentioned earlier also are featured. The closeness of all parts of this region to the sea, as well as to the islands off the western coast, means that fish will be found in many meals.

These mouthwatering dishes arent denied to the person with diabetes. The Mediterranean diet, with its emphasis on olive oil, has been shown to be healthy for your heart. One of the key changes you may need to make, however, is to reduce the amount of fat in your ingredients. Olive oil is a fat, and as you add more of it to your dishes, the calories climb rapidly. When Italians worked hard in the fields all day or traveled long distances to hunt or fish, they needed those extra calories to sustain them. But when was the last time you lifted a shovel or bagged a deer?

A second important step is reducing the size of your portion of pasta or risotto, whether you eat it at home or in the wonderful Italian restaurants (see Chapter 17 for more about eating healthy at restaurants). None of the recipes give you more than a cup of pasta or 23 cup of rice. Compare that with the usual 3 cups of pasta at a restaurant, and you quickly discover what changes you need to make.

On the other hand, the great fresh fruits and vegetables in Italian cooking are just what the doctor ordered, like the tomato, the artichoke, and the beans.

These fit perfectly into the new emphasis of the federal food guidelines on fiber and reduction of fat. They also are the reason that Italian food is one of the easiest to convert to vegetarian.

Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 53 Top off your meal with a glass of Chianti from Tuscany. (Chapter 1 tells you about the benefits of alcohol.) But skip the rich Italian desserts or share a dessert with three other people. We dont think these changes will be a hardship.

They take nothing away from the glory of Italian cooking.

Feasting on Mexican food Mexican food comes from the Mayan Indians of the southeastern part of the country. They were hunters and fisherman, so their main sources of food were wild game, such as rabbit and turkey, and fish. Their diet also included beans and corn. The Aztecs later added chocolate, vanilla, honey, and chili peppers. After Spain conquered the country in 1521, the Spanish diet began to influence Mexican food. The Spanish brought livestock like cows and pigs and taught the Mexicans to make cheese and bread.

The type of Mexican food that has become so popular in the United States, the burrito, is a stuffed wheat tortilla. The Spanish brought in the wheat, so the burrito isnt exactly an indigenous food of Mexico. The Mexican tortilla is made of cornmeal, not wheat.

Mexico has been influenced by other colonial powers, including France, Portugal, all of the surrounding islands in the Caribbean, West Africa, and South America.

As a result of the influences of other countries, Mexican food can be much more complex than the burrito. If you buy a small burrito, you get a fairly good combination of beans, chicken or beef, rice, and salsa, but you may also get your daily dose of salt in this single food. When you make your own, however, you can control the amount of salt.

The ingredients in a burrito, minus the high salt content, can make a nice meal in a hurry. When you make burritos, be sure to avoid cheese and excessive rice and watch out, especially, for the hot pepper. Leave out the chicken or beef, and you can enjoy a delicious vegetarian burrito.

Savoring Thai food Thai food is a good choice for people with diabetes. It is cooked with little fat because stir-frying is the method of choice. Thai cooking keeps the meat, fish, and poultry to small quantities, thus providing taste rather than bulk, as in a Western diet. The dipping sauces have strong tastes, so theyre used in very small quantities, minimizing the salt and sugar in the diet. Vegetables 54 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes are eaten in larger quantities. At the end of the meal Thais enjoy fruits like mango, pineapple, guava, and papaya, which provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Therefore, its easy to convert to vegetarian eating when you eat Thai food. Just leave out the meat, fish, or poultry.

Thai food, like Italian food, is also the product of many influences.

Westerners introduced milk into Thai cooking, and because coconut milk is so readily available, this became a staple of Thai dishes. The Chinese coming down from the north brought stir-frying with them, as well as noodles.

Thanks to the Chinese, the five basic flavors of Asian cuisine  bitter, salt, sour, hot, and sweet  were established, and Thai meals use them as their basis for a balance of flavors. Dishes made with soy and ginger are a good example.

India brought curry dishes to Thailand, with coconut milk serving as an antidote to the hot spices in some of those curry dishes. The Thais have put their own delicious stamp on these curries, using a lot of green chili pepper, also given to them originally by Westerners.

Southern Thai food is usually hot and spicy, and fish is a major ingredient because the area is so close to the sea. However, you can always get dishes that arent so spicy, and the subtle tastes of good Thai cooking have made it tremendously popular in the United States and throughout the world wherever Thais are found. Rice generally is part of the meal.

Most Thai dishes have garlic, a condiment that grows all over Thailand.

Coconut milk, actually a combination of the coconut flesh and the liquid inside the coconut, is added to Thai curries and soups. Fish sauce, made by fermenting shrimp, salt, and water together, takes the place of soy sauce in Thai cooking.

In American Thai restaurants, a dish called pad thai has become a favorite entre. It means Thai-style stir-fried noodles and was brought to Thailand by the Chinese. When employment was low in Thailand after World War II, the government promoted noodle shops and stalls as a way of getting people back to work, and pad thai noodles became popular throughout the country.

Thai immigrants brought the dish to the United States. Its not exactly representative of the finest Thai cuisine, but its eaten so frequently in the United States that it must be considered when the diabetic has Thai food, particularly because the sauce often contains a lot of sugar. A small portion of pad thai is fine for the person with diabetes, but leave at least half the serving for another day.

Thai food is so nutritious that there is little about it to warn the person with diabetes. As always, avoid large portions and too much rice. And be careful of the hot spices.

Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 55 Eating the rest of the worlds cuisine Covering all the worlds wonderful cuisines in detail isnt possible in this book.

We tried to cover the most popular foods in the English-speaking world, but we could devote an entire book to every type of cuisine. We know that we left out delicious cuisines that many of you love from other countries, such as Greece, India, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Brazil. But we hope that you will still come away with a few general tips about these foods from around the world:  You dont have to give up the foods you love because you have diabetes.

Food is also love, sharing, social status, wealth (which it represented for slaves), and a lot more.

You can avoid the empty calories in fatty, sugary desserts.

56 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes  The biggest problem is the large size of the portions. Try sharing or saving the food for another meal instead.

A lot of exercise will reverse the damage of just about any dietary indiscretion.

You can reduce the fat in your food, and it will still be delicious.

You can reduce the salt and lower your blood pressure.

We want you to learn to eat to live  not live to eat. What you put in your mouth has a lot to do with your state of health, no matter where the food comes from.

Stocking Up with the Right Ingredients Some common ingredients are used in many different recipes. Having them at hand is convenient, saving you needless trips to the market and more expo-sure to foods you dont need.

Some of the foods that belong in every kitchen or pantry (if youre a vegetarian, make the appropriate substitutions) include the following: For the freezer: Chicken breasts Fruit juice concentrate Egg substitute Loaf of bread Frozen fruit Soft margarine For the pantry: Canned fruit Oils (olive, canola, peanut) Canned tomatoes Onions Canned tuna, salmon in water Pasta Dried fruit, unsugared Pasta sauce Evaporated skim milk Peanut butter Fat-free salad dressing Potatoes Fresh garlic Red and white cooking wines Fruit spreads Reduced-calorie mayonnaise Grains (rice, couscous) Reduced-sodium broths Ketchup Reduced-sodium soy sauce Legumes (peas, beans, lentils) Sugar-free cocoa mix Mustard Tomato paste Nonfat dry milk Vinegars Nonstick cooking sprays Worcestershire sauce Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 57 For baking: Baking powder Extracts (vanilla, lemon, almond) Baking soda Flour (all-purpose, whole-wheat) Cocoa powder Rolled oats Cornstarch Semisweet chocolate Cream of tartar Sugar-free gelatin Dry bread crumbs Unflavored gelatin Sweeteners: Artificial sweeteners Molasses Honey Sugar Light maple syrup Seasonings: Dried herbs Pepper Fresh herbs and spices Salt With these ingredients, youre ready for just about any of the recipes in the book. The exceptions are exotic ingredients, such as in ethnic foods, that you can buy in specialty stores as you need them.

Prepare a list of these ingredients and make multiple copies so that you can check off what you need before you go to the market. Leave a little space for the perishables such as fresh fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, fish, and poultry.

In the next chapter, we tell you more about the process of shopping for these ingredients.

Using the Right Tools Just as you wouldnt try to bang in a nail with a shoe (especially with your foot inside), dont try to cook without the right tools. Spending a little more at the beginning pays huge dividends later on. For example, get the best set of knives you can afford. They make all cutting jobs much easier, and they last a long time. Buy good nonstick pans; they make cooking without oils much easier.

58 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Heres the basic equipment that all kitchens should have in order to turn out delicious meals: Chopping boards Pots and pans Food processor Salad spinner Knives Scales Measuring cups and spoons Steamer with double boiler Microwave Thermometers (for roasts and turkey) Mixer with dough hook Making Simple Modifications You can make all kinds of simple modifications that will reduce calories and reduce the amounts of foods (such as those containing cholesterol) that you are trying to keep in check. You can see that many of the modifications take you in the direction of vegetarianism. You can easily do the following:  Use skim milk instead of whole milk.

Use cuts of meat that are low in fat instead of high-fat meats. Lowfat meats include lean beef, lean pork, and skinless white-meat poultry.

Trim all visible fat off meats and poultry.

Stay away from packaged luncheon meats, which tend to be high in fat.

Select foods that are low in sodium and saturated fats (check the label on the food).

Choose high-fiber foods like whole fruits, vegetables, and grains.

Enjoy nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream.

Have dressings, sauces, and gravies served on the side.

Substitute lentils and beans for meat, fish, and poultry.

Replace butter with olive oil, herbs, spices, or lemon juice.

Prepare foods by baking, broiling, and so on  any method other than frying.

Use your imagination to come up with your own unique ways to cut calories and fat.

Chapter 4: Eating What You Like 59 Taking Holiday Measures This is a particularly good heading for this section, because the key to getting through a holiday in good diabetic control is to control the portions of everything you eat during the holidays. Eating too much is easy.

If you encounter the killer B, a buffet table, vow to make only one trip.

Youll probably fill your plate with more food than you need, so plan to leave a large portion on the plate. Focus on the foods that you should eat and avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods, particularly desserts. Stick to fruits for high-fiber, low-calorie desserts.

If youre invited to a potluck dinner, make something that you know will work for your nutritional plan. You can certainly find something in this book that fits for you. These recipes have all been taste-tested and are delicious, so you dont have to think that youre bringing something inferior. We suggest that you have a snack before you go to a party so that you dont arrive feeling hungry.

Most important of all, try to forget the all-or-nothing mind-set. If you go off your nutritional plan once or twice, put the lapse behind you and get back to doing the things you know are right for you. The benefits will be immediate in the form of a general feeling of well-being and, of course, long-term in the fact that you wont develop the long-term complications of diabetes.

60 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Contents How the Supermarket Can Help 61 Chapter 5 Going to the Market with a Plan 61 How the Supermarket Can Help Deciphering the Mysterious Food Label In This Chapter 67  Having a grocery shopping plan  Reading the Nutrition Facts label  Arming yourself to make good choices Making Good Choices 69 Every trip to the market is an adventure. This chapter is about coping with the challenge of going grocery shopping without being lured into buying items that arent good for your diabetes nutritional plan. But its also about overcoming your natural desire to take home what you know isnt good for you.

You deserve the best, and that holds true for the food you eat as much as anything else. Of course, you could be like the man whose doctor told him that the best thing he could do for himself would be to get on a really good diet, stop chasing women, and stop drinking so much alcohol. The patient replied: I dont deserve the best. What about second best? We hope you wont settle for second best.

Going to the Market with a Plan If you have a hobby, youve probably developed a series of steps by which you can accomplish your hobby in the most efficient manner, whether its painting pictures or raising tomatoes. If you paint pictures, you certainly wouldnt start painting without deciding on a subject and buying the right paints, brushes, and canvas. If you raise tomatoes, you prepare the soil, add amendments such as manure, and buy the seeds or, more likely, the plants.

You use a watering system as well as tomato cages to hold up your crop.

You should plan your excursion to the market in the same careful manner.

Decide in advance what you need that complies with your nutritional plan. In Chapter 4, we give you a list of recommendations for the staples you should 62 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes have at home. You can use those suggestions to make a shopping list to make sure that you purchase what you need. To that list, add the perishables that youll use immediately, such as meat and poultry or fish, milk and other dairy products, and, of course, fruits and vegetables.

Eat something before you go to the market so that you arent hungry as you walk down the aisles.

A market is like a huge menu set up to entice you. Most markets are set up in the same way. This setup is not by accident. Its arranged to encourage you to buy. What people buy on the impulse of the moment is often the most calorie-concentrated and expensive food that is least appropriate for them.

Youll find that all the perishable food is arranged around the perimeter of the market. The high-calorie foods are in the aisles in the middle of the store. Unless you want to take the long way around, you must go through those aisles to get to the meat, milk, fruit, and vegetables. You pass the loose candies, the cookies, the high-sugar cereals, and all the other no-nos. If you prepare a list and buy only from the list, you wont purchase any of those foods. Walking into the market hungry and without a list is dangerous for your health.

Sometimes the market employs a person who is trained to help people with medical conditions avoid bad choices. Check with your market to find out whether such a person is on staff, and spend some time touring the aisles with him or her. Youll get some valuable insights that will make handling a shopping trip easier.

Some keys to shopping the market most effectively include the following:  Shop at the same market each time.

Shop as seldom as you can.

Go to the market when it is not crowded.

Dont walk every aisle.

Dont be tempted by free samples. Theyre usually high in calories to appeal to your taste buds.

If you bring your kids (not advisable) to the store, make sure that they arent hungry.

Be especially careful in the checkout lane, where stores force you to run through a gauntlet of goodies  none of which are good for you.

Most markets offer a variety of sections. Each one presents a different challenge and requires a different strategy. You should probably work your way around the market from the bottom of the food pyramid to the top, choosing Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help 63 lots of grains, fewer fruits, vegetables, and dairy and meat products, and fats and sweets least of all. (Check out Chapter 2 for more about the food pyramid.) The supermarket isnt the only place where you can find good food. Check out your local farmers market. Most areas have these markets, and many are open all year. And be sure to look into specialty food stores where you can find some of the more exotic ingredients.

The bakery You can really make a dent in your diet in the bakery section, where all the desserts are on display. These foods usually contain too much fat and carbohydrate; however, you dont have to give up all your treats. The key is to figure a rich dessert into your meal plan, but only on an occasional basis.

Remember to keep the portion small, in any case.

Muffins and pastries are usually high in fat, but in deference to the popular belief that fat makes us fat, stores now sell lowfat muffins and pastries. The problem is that these still contain many calories, so dont overdo it. Try a smaller portion or share your muffin with a friend. A popular choice is angel food cake, but watch out because, even though its totally fat-free, its filled with calories. You can enjoy a small portion.

Select breads that have at least 2 grams of fiber per slice and whole-grain breads. Bagels and English muffins should be whole-grain as well. Dont forget that theyre usually too large, so plan on eating a serving of half or less. (That goes for any bread.) If you eat too much, youll consume too many calories.

Produce Fruits and vegetables are in the produce section. Stores continue to offer the usual apples, pears, and bananas, but today they stock more fruits and vegetables that you may never have seen before. Here is where you can add some real variety to your diet. Try some of these new items, and you may discover that you can substitute them for the cakes, pies, and other concentrated calorie foods that you now eat. For example, you may find that you like some of the new varieties of melons, which are sweet and have a great texture.

The other benefit to trying new fruits and vegetables is that you get a variety of vitamins and minerals from the different sources. Each differently colored vegetable provides different vitamins, so pick out a variety of colors.

64 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes To prolong their season, you can freeze some of the fruits, especially the berries, and use them as you need them.

Remember that dried fruits have very concentrated carbohydrate and should be used sparingly.

Root vegetables need no refrigeration but must be kept in a cool, dry place.

Most of the other vegetables must go in the refrigerator.

The dairy case At the dairy case, you can make some very positive diet modifications. Go for the lowest fat content you can eat, but dont neglect the dairy part of the food guide pyramid. Thats where you get calcium. Try to find lowfat cheeses, yogurt, and cottage cheese. You can even buy cheeses that arent lowfat if you use them sparingly. Go for 1 percent or even skim milk if possible.

The deli counter A deli counter offers luncheon meats and prepared foods. Recent studies show that these processed meats are dangerous to your health. These foods often contain a lot of salt and fat. You probably want to avoid most of the foods in this area (with the exception of prepared chicken, which is often spit-roasted and very tasty). Even the lowfat meats in this section are rich in salt.

The pickled foods may also contain a great deal of salt, despite being low in calories and free of fat.

If you choose salads from this area, pick out those that contain oil instead of cream. Dont be afraid to ask a deli employee about the exact ingredients in these prepared foods. In some cases, lower-fat versions are available. People often prefer fatty foods  and the grocery obviously wants people to buy the food  so the market caters to those preferences.

The fresh meat and fish counter The fresh meat and fish counter provides some good choices for your protein needs. At the meat counter, buy no more than a normal serving for each member of the family. Just because the meat attendant has cut a 12-ounce piece of swordfish doesnt mean that you have to buy the whole thing. You are entitled to get just the piece you want. For convenience, you can get two Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help 65 servings at one time if you know you have the willpower to save the second serving for another meal. Ask the attendant to cut the fish in half so you arent tempted to eat the whole thing.

Dont forget that lentils and other legumes can provide protein as well.

The same study mentioned above that criticized processed meats found that people who eat meat in general are heavier and have more diabetes than those who dont. Look for lowfat cuts of meat. The best choices for you are top round, sirloin, and flank steak. These tend to be the leanest cuts of meat and are also very tasty. When buying chopped meat (for hamburgers, for example), consider how you plan to cook it. If you like meat cooked well done, you dont always have to choose the package with the lowest fat content, because the fat may be cooked out. Otherwise, look for lower-fat chopped meat.

Try to buy skinless poultry to eliminate a major source of the fat in chicken.

You may have to cook it a shorter time, or you can barbecue the chicken using an indirect method (place the coals along the sides of the chicken rather than underneath). The chicken will be much juicier and not dried out.

Try to eat fish at least twice a week because of the positive effect it has on blood fats. Remember that a fatty fish such as salmon is good for you but adds extra fat calories.

The fresh meat and fish counter usually offers breaded or battered fish to make your life easier; you only have to put it in the oven. The problem is that the breading or batter often contains too much butter, fat, and salt. Ask the person serving you for a list of the ingredients in the breading or batter. Or better yet, skip the prepared fish and head for the fresh. If you notice a very fishy smell, then the fish is not very fresh.

Frozen foods and diet meals When the season for your favorite fresh fruits and vegetables is over, the frozen food section may stock these items. However, because markets now often bring in more varieties of fresh food from all over the world year-round, you may not need to turn to frozen products as much.

Food manufacturers are producing a variety of frozen foods, which you can heat in the microwave oven. These meals are often high in fat and salt, however. Be sure to read the food label, which we explain later in this chapter.

Avoid frozen foods mixed with cream or cheese sauces.

66 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Diet meals can be a good choice if you want to save time in preparation. The frozen diet meals are low in calories and often low in salt and fat as well.

Most diet meals have no more than 350 kilocalories and usually taste good. If you have type 1 diabetes and need to count carbohydrates, theyre listed on the box.

Healthy Choice, Lean Cuisine, and Weight Watchers are the three main makers of diet meals, all of which can be counted on for low calories and good taste. Healthy Choice is the lowest in salt. Grocery stores usually have one brand or another on sale, so you can choose the least expensive brand when you shop.

Are frozen diet foods a good choice for you? Many of our patients complain that they lack time to prepare the right foods. For those people, prepared diet meals work very well. For the person who likes to involve him or herself in food preparation  for example, people who bought this book for the wonderful recipes  this is not the way to go.

Low-carbohydrate foods are also being made by many of the food manufacturers. See our discussion of the various types of diets in Chapter 3 for ways that these foods can fit in your nutrition plan.

Canned and bottled foods Canned and bottled foods can be healthful and can help you quickly make recipes calling for ingredients such as tomato sauce. Check the Nutrition Facts label (covered later in this chapter) to determine what kind of liquid a food is canned in. Oil adds a lot of fat calories, so look for the same food canned in water.

Canned vegetables often contain too much salt, so look for low-salt varieties.

Canned fruits often contain too much sweetener, so youre better off with fresh if possible.

Watch for this marketing trick: Stores often display higher-priced canned foods at eye level and lower priced products on lower shelves. Also, store brands are often less expensive and just as good as name brands.

Bottled foods include fruit juice drinks, which are high in sugar and low in nutrition. Youre better off drinking pure fruit juice rather than a juice drink diluted with other ingredients.

The same principle is true for bottled and canned soda, which has no nutritional value and lots of calories. Substitute water for this expensive and Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help 67 basically worthless food that really doesnt quench your thirst (soft drinks often leave an aftertaste, especially the diet drinks). Try adding lemon or lime to your water or use the flavored calorie-free water drinks.

You can find lowfat or fat-free salad dressing and mayonnaise in this area.

Better yet, try using mustard and some of the other condiments to spice up your salads without adding many calories.

The best choices for snacks You probably frequently feel like eating a little something between meals.

Your choice of foods may make the difference between weight gain and weight control, between high blood glucose levels and normal levels.

Here are the best selections to choose as you make your way around the supermarket:  Baked chips: Avoid fried chips, which add lots of fat calories. An ounce of baked chips amounts to 110 kilocalories.

Flavored rice cakes: These items are filling without calories.

Fruit and fig bars: These items can satisfy hunger without many kilocalories. A couple of Fig Newmans, for example, will set you back only 120 kilocalories.

Lowfat granola: Watch out for regular granola, which is high in calories.

Depending on the brand, 12 cup of lowfat granola contains 220 to 250 kilocalories.

Plain popcorn: If you prepare it in an air-popping machine or a microwave oven, it contains only 30 kilocalories per cup and is free of salt and fat.

Raisins and other dried fruit: Stick to small portions. A quarter of a cup of raisins is only 130 kilocalories.

The preceding list should give you enough choices to satisfy your hunger without wrecking your diabetic control.

Deciphering the Mysterious Food Label Most packaged foods have a food label known as the Nutrition Facts label, which isnt really mysterious if you know how to interpret it. It was designed to be understood. Figure 5-1 shows a typical food label. The contents of the Nutrition Facts label are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

68 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes Figure 5-1: A Nutrition Facts food label.

The label in Figure 5-1 is from a 1-pound container of cottage cheese with fruit. You can find the following information on the label:  Serving Size: The serving size is the portion of the total contents that makes up one serving. Most packaged foods serve more than one person so dont be fooled.

Servings Per Container: At 12 cup, this container holds 4 servings.

Calories: The number of kilocalories in a serving  in this case, 120 kilocalories.

Calories from Fat: The number of fat kilocalories in each serving.

% Daily Value: The nutrient amounts appear in grams or milligrams and also as % Daily Value. The % Daily Value refers to the percentage of the daily value for a person on a 2,000-kilocalorie-per-day diet.

Total Fat: The total fat is 1.5 grams, of which 1.0 is saturated fat. The fact that theres less than 3 grams of fat allows the producer to refer to this product as lowfat.

Saturated Fat: The amount of the fat in each serving that is saturated.

Cholesterol: This food provides little cholesterol. Therefore, the producer could call it low cholesterol because that term applies if the product provides less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol and 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving (see Chapter 2 for more information).

Sodium: At 290 milligrams of sodium, this food provides 12% of the sodium allowed in a 2,000-kilocalorie-a-day diet.

Chapter 5: How the Supermarket Can Help 69  Total Carbohydrate: As a person with diabetes, you need to know the grams of carbohydrate in a serving, both to fit it into your nutritional plan and to determine insulin needs if that is what you take.

Dietary Fiber: This food provides no fiber, so all the carbohydrate is digestible. If fiber were present, you could subtract the fiber grams from the total grams of carbohydrate to get the actual grams from carbohydrate absorbed.

Sugars: The fact that 14 of the 15 grams of carbohydrate come from sugar means that the sugar will be absorbed rapidly.

Protein: As a person with diabetes, youre most concerned with the grams of protein in a portion. The figure for % Daily Value doesnt help you in planning your diet.

Vitamins and Minerals: Usually, the label provides the % Daily Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. Some food labels follow that information with a list of ingredients, but this information isnt required as part of the Nutrition Facts label.

Making Good Choices Thanks to the food labels, you can choose foods that are lower in calories, lower in fat, and have more nutritional value. You can compare foods next to one another and choose the healthier item. For example:  Smart Balance has only 60 kcal per tablespoon while I Cant Believe Its Not Butter has 90 kcal per tablespoon.

Uncle Bens Fast and Natural Whole Grain Instant Brown Rice has 170 kcal per cup while Uncle Bens Ready Rice Whole Grain Brown has 240 kcal per cup.

Natures Own Double Fiber Wheat Bread has 100 kcal per 2 slices while Arnold Double Fiber Whole Wheat Bread has 200 kcal per 2 slices.

Annies Naturals Buttermilk Dressing has 60 kcal in 2 tablespoons while Kens Steak House Thousand Islands Dressing has 140 kcal per 2 tablespoons.

Campbells Healthy Request Condensed Chicken Noodle Soup has 60 kcal per cup while Campbells Condensed Vegetable Soup has 100 kcal per cup.

70 Part I: Thriving with Diabetes I could go on and on like this but you get the idea. There are tons of good choices that have fewer calories and often more fiber, vitamins, and minerals than the bad choices. You just need to spend a little time and look at the labels.

Be sure you are comparing one serving to one serving. If you compare one serving to two servings, the larger item is bound to have many more calories.

The best way to verify that your trip to the market has been successful is to evaluate the contents of your grocery sacks. The division of the contents should look similar to the food guide pyramid (see Chapter 2).

Understanding Diabetic Breakfasts Breakfast is a critical meal for a diabetic. Getting your day off to a steady, balanced start sets you up for success the rest of the day. Check out Chapter 4 if you need help planning your meals for the day based on your individual needs. The following sections can help you make the right breakfast choices.

Figuring out which fruit is right for you Fruit doesnt have to be a dirty word for a diabetic. While its true that fruit is full of natural sugars and your body processes them quickly, you dont have to (and shouldnt) mark them off your list completely.

74 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Whole fruit, rather than juice, is a better choice for diabetics. The fiber and skin in whole fruit slow down the digestion of the fruit, resulting in a more gradual rise in your blood sugar level.

Heres a list of fruits with a lower glycemic index (which I discuss in more detail in Chapter 2):  Apples  Apricots  Blueberries  Cherries  Grapefruit  Kiwis  Strawberries And just for balance, here are a few fruits with a higher glycemic index:  Cantaloupe  Dates  Pineapple  Raisins  Watermelon Just because a fruit has a higher glycemic index doesnt mean you cant eat it.

Just take it into consideration when you plan when you eat it and what you eat with it.

Putting together protein-packed punches Eggs arent the only breakfast protein. In fact, many diabetics must limit their intake of cholesterol, and eggs are an easy target for removal. (Check out Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes, later in this chapter, for smart ways to include eggs at breakfast.) Consider other nontraditional choices when youre making your breakfast changes. Heres a list of protein-rich foods that might make a good addition to your breakfast table:  1 turkey hot dog wrapped in a whole-wheat tortilla  1 ounce boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce  2 tablespoons of peanut butter on whole-wheat toast  1 slice turkey wrapped around lowfat string cheese Chapter 6: The Benefits of Breakfast 75  4-ounce grilled chicken breast  14 cup cottage cheese with diced grape tomatoes Starting with Whole-Grain Goodness When you received your diagnosis of diabetes, maybe you thought your days of eating waffles and pancakes were over. Although starting the morning off with pancakes dripping with butter and maple syrup is probably not in your current eating plan, you can still enjoy relatively sweet treats in the morning, especially if you use whole grains.

Refined grains are processed to remove the bran and the hull, and along with them, up to 90 percent of the nutrients, including vitamins E and B. Whole grains have a lower glycemic index than refined grains. So whole grains are less likely to send your blood glucose soaring and then dipping. The protein, fat, and fiber in whole grains slow their absorption into the bloodstream. In addition, whole grains make you feel fuller and stay fuller longer.

Read labels carefully to ensure that the food youre getting is made from whole grains. Dont just look for wheat bread; make sure it says whole wheat.

Some manufactures add caramel color or molasses to refined flour and sell the bread as wheat bread, potentially confusing hopeful healthy eaters.

T Warm Blueberry Oats This recipe makes any morning special. Its just as quick as regular oatmeal, but adding fresh blueberries gives your antioxidant levels a boost and your taste buds a treat. If fresh blueberries arent in season, you can substitute frozen. Choose blueberries frozen without additional sugars and thaw them before adding them to your cereal.

Enjoying Egg-ceptional Dishes Choosing eggs gives you a protein power punch to start your day. This simple food is an ideal source of protein, containing all essential amino acids.

Eggs are also a source of B complex vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc. However, egg yolks also contain a significant amount of cholesterol. Consequently, low-cholesterol diets restrict the number of eggs allowed each week. People with diabetes should limit their eggs to a couple per week for the same reason.

One great way to enjoy eggs but limit your cholesterol is to enjoy egg whites or use a combination of whole eggs and egg whites. The egg yolk (the yellow center) contains the dreaded cholesterol, so limiting your intake of yolks may be enough to keep egg whites on your list.

Instead many people entertain friends and family with heavy appetizers. Ive collected some recipes that are heavy in satisfaction, but wont weigh you down or blow your whole calorie budget for the day.

92 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great If your experience with seafood until now has been fish sticks or broiled halibut, weve got some great ideas for getting you going with seafood appetizers. You can experiment with new flavors without committing yourself to a full seafood entree. But be sure to take a look at Chapter 12 for more taste-tempting seafood recipes.

Most people dont get enough seafood in their diet. Rich in fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, calcium, and so many other nutrients, seafood is an excellent part of any well-rounded diet. This delectable food is much lower in cholesterol than beef and chicken and has so many varied flavors and textures that you cant get bored with it.

Shellfish, such as scallops and shrimp, are sold by weight and size. When you see shrimp labeled as 26/30, you get between 26 and 30 shrimp per pound.

So the higher the number, the smaller the shrimp, and vice versa. You may even see labels that say U10, which means under 10, or fewer than 10 shrimp per pound.

Always clean your shrimp properly before cooking them. If you buy your shrimp in a grocery store, the head will most likely be removed. But the shrimp may or may not be deveined, which means the dark vein that runs down the back of the shrimps tail may still be present. Because this veinlike object is actually the shrimps intestinal track, you should remove it before cooking the shrimp. At your grocery or kitchen supply store (anywhere kitchen gadgets are sold), pick up a tool called a shrimp deveiner and run it along the back end of the shrimp. It cracks the shell and removes the vein in one easy step. Then rinse the shrimp in cool water. Check out Figure 7-1 to see the deveining process.

Figure 7-1: You can use a special tool to clean and devein shrimp safely and properly.

96 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Savoring Salsas Weve fallen in love with the Mexican condiment, salsa. Most store-bought versions, however, have too much sugar and vinegar, so they arent nearly as good as the homemade variety. Why bother with those versions when its so easy to create your own? Although salsa simply means sauce, we think youll agree that these salsa recipes taste anything but simple.

Stocking essentials for scrumptious salsas Add the standard salsa seasonings to any grain or legume for a tasty and nutritious treat anytime. You can flavor cooked brown rice, quinoa, or any cooked beans with any of these tasty additions:  Cilantro  Garlic  Lime juice or lemon juice  Onions  Peppers (such as serranos and jalapeos)  Tomatoes Check out the following salsa recipes, which use these delicious ingredients.

Use caution when slicing and dicing hot peppers such as jalapeos. Use your knife, not your fingers or fingernails, to remove the super-spicy ribs and seeds, and consider wearing gloves if you have sensitive skin. The pepper oil can get stuck under your nails, making it painful to touch your eyes, nose, or any other moist parts later. And if your skin is exposed to sunlight with residual pepper oil, you can get a nasty burn.

T Mexican Salsa Chowing down some Mexican salsa is a great way to get a good helping of lycopene, because tomatoes happen to be one of the best sources. Lycopene, a great antioxidant that helps fight heart disease, has also been shown to help prevent prostate cancer and maintain eye health. If youre a fan of cilantro like we are, toss in a bit more. Serve the salsa (shown in the color section) with pitas or tortilla chips.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Yield: 4 servings Chapter 7: Hors dOeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start 97 12 teaspoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon fresh chopped jalapeo pepper 12 teaspoon salt 1 small garlic clove, chopped fine 1 pound fresh tomatoes, cored and chopped 1 teaspoon fresh chopped cilantro 12 medium onion, diced 1 In a mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice and salt. Stir to dissolve the salt.

2 Add the tomatoes and coat them with the juice. Add the onion, jalapeo, garlic, and cilantro and stir.

Tip: If you like a smooth rather than chunky salsa, toss all the ingredients in a food processor and process the mixture in pulses until it reaches the consistency you desire.

Adding citrus and other fruits to salsas To give your salsa a fruity twist, dont bother with bottled lemon or lime juice. Fresh is definitely the way to go. Squeezing the juice out is easy to do, and the flavor is far superior.

Heres how to get the most out of your citrus fruit. Check out Figure 7-3 for details.

1. Roll the fruit on a hard, flat surface, pressing down fairly hard to break up the juice sacs.

2. Cut the citrus fruit in half width-wise.

3. Holding one half in one hand, stick the tines of a fork into the fruit pulp and squeeze the fruit.

Twist the fork as needed to release as much juice as possible.

Juice your fruit over a separate bowl, not into other ingredients. Doing so helps you catch any errant seeds that may try to sneak their way into your delectable dishes.

Lemon and lime arent the only fruity flavors you can add to your salsas.

Check out the following yummy salsas featuring mango and pineapple.

Chapter 7: Hors dOeuvres and First Courses: Off to a Good Start 99 T Warm Pineapple Salsa Fruit salsa can be a terrific sauce for fish, veggies, or pita wedges. Or use it like a jam or syrup to top biscuits, waffles, or pancakes. With cooked fruit salsa, you heat the ingredients until they almost become a glaze. Fruit salsa has a more syrupy consistency than a tomato-based salsa. Experiment and enjoy.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 tablespoon slivered almonds 14 teaspoon salt 1 small onion, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon honey 2 teaspoons curry powder 1 tablespoon brown seedless raisins 16 ounces pineapple tidbits, drained 1 In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the almonds and gently toss in the oil.

2 Add the onion and cook until tender and until the almonds are golden brown.

3 Add the curry powder, pineapple, vinegar, salt, honey, and raisins. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the salsa from the heat and serve warm.

Vary It! Try this recipe with canned mandarin oranges, apricots, or peaches instead of the pineapple, depending on your accompaniments and your taste buds on a given day. But be sure to avoid fruit packed in heavy syrup.

Discovering Delicious Dips Dips dont have to be fat-laden creamy concoctions that add inches to your waistline and bags to your saddle. With a little creativity, you can create delicious dips that keep you eating healthy and your glucose levels normal.

100 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Whipping up dips with pantry staples Dips are among the quickest and easiest (not to mention tastiest!) appetizers around. Keep your pantry and fridge stocked with a few dip-making essentials and youll never be stuck wondering what to whip up when unexpected guests stop by.

Here are our best bets for quick dip-making essentials to keep on hand:  Any of the ingredients listed under Stocking essentials for scrumptious salsas, earlier in this chapter: Adding any of the salsa ingredients to any of the items in this list makes for a terrific dip. In fact, one of our favorite quick dips blends a can of black beans (rinsed and drained, of course) with 12 cup of salsa. Whip the mixture in a food processor, and you have an instant party treat.

Beans: Pureed beans make a great base for a dip, and theyre high in fiber and low in fat. Blend them in a food processor and season them with your favorite spices. Look for fat-free, low-sodium canned beans, and try cannellini beans, black beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, great Northern beans, navy beans, and kidney beans.

Unless a recipe says otherwise, rinse and drain canned beans before adding them to a dip. Often, the liquid theyre canned in is salty or flavored in some way. Rinse and drain and season them your way.

Fancy olives: Olives impart great flavor and texture to dips. Use some of the olive juice to blend into the dip, too. If olives perk up a martini, just think what they can do for some ho-hum dips!

Fresh herbs: Fresh herbs make an instant impression on an otherwise bland dip base. Dill, basil, and cilantro are excellent choices for keeping on hand.

Lowfat sour cream: Use sour cream to add a little body and creamy texture to your dips.

Plain yogurt: This staple is a natural partner to fresh herbs and a touch of lemon juice. Keep it handy to mix in a soon-to-be bean dip.

Spice blends: Look for prepackaged, salt-free spice blends. These healthy spices can take the guesswork out of seasoning.

T White Bean Dip Heres a great dip that takes advantage of a well-stocked pantry. Add fresh baby spinach leaves during Step 1 to boost your vitamins and leafy greens quotient. Delicious!

Choosing healthy dippers Whats a good dip without something to dip into it? Rather than ruining all your hard work of choosing healthy dips by dipping fried chips into them, we offer you the following alternatives to keep you moving in the right direction:  Bagel chips: Look for these chips in the specialty bread section of your grocery store, but read the label because some are high in fat and sodium. You also can make your own by slicing off slivers of a bagel and then baking them until theyre crisp.

Fresh veggies: Choose broccoli florets, cauliflower florets, carrot sticks, celery sticks, zucchini slices, red pepper spears, endive scoops, or any of your favorites. Any veggie can be a dip delivery system.

Pita wedges: Make your own by quartering pitas and then baking them until theyre crisp.

Whole-wheat crackers: Kashi makes a line called TLC, Tasty Little Crackers, made with whole-grain flour from seven different grains.

Ry-Krisp is a filling and tasty choice as well.

Yucca chips: This root vegetable has great health benefits. Check out the following recipe.

No matter what T Chilled Cucumber Soup the weather, the state of your health, or whos T Cucumber and Avocado Soup coming for dinner, we have a soup for you.

T Rhubarb Soup with Fresh Strawberries In this chapter, we get you started with the basics T Watermelon Gazpacho of making soup, taking you through the steps to make sure your soups turn out just right. We give you the scoop on different types of stocks, pro- vide tips on watching your salt intake, and help you get your pantry stocked for soup making. We give you tips on making healthful, creamy soups full of flavor, but low in fat. And finally, we help you make delicious soups to serve cold on warm summer days.

Understanding Soup-Making Basics In many soup recipes, the first few steps ask you to saut some vegetables to bring out their flavor and soften them. Typically, you start by cooking a combination of vegetables, such as onions, carrots, and celery, along with herbs and spices, in a small amount of fat.

You may saut your veggies in a small amount of lowfat cooking spray oil or butter, or even a bit of fatty smoked meat such as bacon. You may also brown ground meats or cubed meats at this stage. As the ingredients cook, they begin to turn brown and caramelize, developing a rich and complex flavor.

106 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Next, you add liquid, perhaps some vegetable broth, chicken or beef broth, milk, wine, or water. First, add just a half-cup or so of liquid to deglaze the pot. During this procedure, you can use a wooden spoon and gently dislodge any bits of caramelized vegetables stuck to the bottom of the pot. You want these flavorful morsels to blend in with the other flavors of the soup. Pour in the remaining liquid.

In the final, and longest, steps of cooking, you place all vegetable chunks, beans, grains, or meats, in the simmering liquid and cook to perfection. But not everything cooks at the same rate, so use Table 8-1 to help you decide when to add ingredients.

Table 8-1 Cooking Times for Soup Add-Ins Ingredient Cooking Time Beans, dried (presoaked 8 hours) 112 hours to 2 hours Beef cubes 2 to 3 hours Chicken, bone in, pieces 40 minutes Chicken, boneless 15 to 20 minutes Fresh vegetables 10 to 15 minutes (45 to pure) Greens (spinach and others) 3 to 5 minutes Lentils, dried 15 to 30 minutes Pasta, dried 8 to 12 minutes Pearl barley 50 minutes to 1 hour Potatoes, white or sweet (diced) 30 minutes Rice, brown and wild 45 to 55 minutes Rice, white 15 to 20 minutes Root vegetables (beets, turnips, and so on) 15 to 35 minutes Seafood, shel ed or boneless 5 to 15 minutes These cooking times are only guidelines, so adjust them as you see fit.

Experiment and figure out what works for you.

Soups are a great way to work in your veggies. Use soups as a way to maximize the bounty of summer vegetables at your local farmers market, especially at the end of the season. Look for these must-have ingredients that have a place in soups, salads, or even quick-cooking pasta sauces:  Beets  Greens (spinach, cabbage, and bok choy among others)  Heirloom tomatoes (look for green zebras, Japanese black trifle, sun sugar, or amana orange, just to name a few) Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 107  Herbs (basil, chervil, dill, and cilantro, or whatever you want)  Mushrooms (exotics, such as morels, chanterelle, and wild mushroom blends)  Squash (chayote, acorn, pumpkin, zucchini, and yellow squash) Stock up on heirloom tomatoes to make the next quick and tasty recipe.

T Heirloom Tomato Soup with Fresh Basil Here is Tante Marie Cooking Schools recommendation for making the most of the summer tomato bounty. The recipe was originally inspired by their friend, T. T. Theyve modified it a bit, to create this incredibly quick and fresh-tasting summer staple.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings 2 tablespoons extra-virgin 5 garlic cloves, peeled and Freshly ground black pepper olive oil minced 30 fresh basil leaves, thinly 5 large fresh heirloom 1 quart good quality low-sodium sliced tomatoes, peeled, seeded, or vegetable stock, heated 1 and chopped into 4 cup freshly grated 12-inch dice 1 teaspoon coarse salt Parmesan cheese 1 Heat olive oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and let cook gently until it turns slightly golden  be careful not to let the garlic burn.

2 Immediately stir in the tomatoes and gently saut until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the stock and let simmer another 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the basil and let the soup simmer gently 2 or 3 minutes more.

3 Serve soup in warmed bowls. Top with Parmesan cheese.

Note: The best way to peel and seed tomatoes is to blanch and shock them, as shown in Figure 11-1 in Chapter 11, to loosen the skin. Start by removing the stem end of the tomato with a small knife. Make an x in the opposite end of the tomato with the knife. Drop the tomatoes in gently boiling water for no longer than 10 seconds. Immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water. Then gently peel off the loosened skins. To seed them, cut the tomatoes in half with the stem end on one side. Over fine mesh strainer fitted onto a bowl or measuring cup, use one hand to scoop out the seeds, while squeezing the tomato half with the other.

Dont worry if you dont get out all the seeds. A couple of seeds wont hurt anyone.

Note: T. T. prefers to cook the tomatoes longer than this recipe suggests. She cooks them with the garlic for 15 minutes; then she adds 3 quarts of stock and simmers the soup another 30 minutes. She says it gives it more flavor. You can try it both ways and choose your favorite.

108 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Summer Vegetable Stew with Egg This summer stew boasts a striking presentation  the delicate broth with chunky vegetables topped with a fried egg. Tante Maries Cooking School worked to develop this nutritional powerhouse that has a good balance of protein and carbohydrates. If youre keeping your veggie drawer well-stocked, you may even have all the ingredients on hand.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 6 servings 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 large or 6 small eggplants, trimmed and cut 2 teaspoons coarse salt, divided in 1-inch pieces 11 2 large or 6 small green zucchini, trimmed and 2 teaspoons ground pepper, divided cut in rounds 2 large onions, halved and sliced 12 tomatoes, coarsely chopped 2 large red peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into thin strips A dash of Tabasco sauce 6 fresh eggs 1 Heat olive oil, 12 teaspoon salt, and the onions in a 10-inch saut pan over moderately high heat. Cook, stirring from time to time, for about 3 minutes; then stir in the peppers.

Continue cooking for another 3 minutes.

2 Toss in the eggplant, season with 12 teaspoon salt and 12 teaspoon pepper, and saut over moderately high heat for about 3 minutes. Stir in the zucchini with another 12 teaspoon salt and 12 teaspoon pepper and continue cooking over moderately high heat.

3 Stir in the tomatoes. Add another sprinkling of salt and pepper, and add the Tabasco.

Let the mixture cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomatoes begin to fall apart.

4 Meanwhile, put a light coating of olive oil in a separate non-stick pan over moderately high heat. When the pan is hot, remove it from the heat, and break the eggs into it, one at a time. Let the eggs cook from the heat of the pan, returning the pan to the heat briefly, and taking it off again, until the whites are set. (The eggs will look like fried eggs, but will not be brown or rubbery on the bottom.) Taste the stew; add additional salt and pepper if necessary. Spoon it into warmed wide bowls, cover each with a pan-fried egg, and serve.

Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 109 Serving Up Soups with Stocks and Other Essentials You can begin a soup using water, but making a soup with real depth of flavor calls for stock. Basically, a stock is a liquid in which solid ingredients, such as chicken meat and bones, vegetables, and spices, are cooked and then usually strained out. The flavors of these ingredients end up in the final broth.

Look for stock bases, the secret ingredient of many a restaurant, near the bouillon and broth in your grocery store. Usually sold in one-pound containers, you can make up to five gallons of stock from a single container. Keeping a container of base in the fridge is more convenient than keeping five gallons of canned broth in your pantry.

Watching out for salt in stock-based soups Most markets carry various brands of chicken and beef broth that offer good flavor. These products are adequate for making everyday soups and are well worth keeping on hand. Always choose the low-sodium versions to use as stock and then add more salt to your soup as necessary.

If your physician or dietitian has given you any instructions at all about watching your salt, youve probably been told about the high sodium content of canned soup. You may be on a standard 3,000-milligrams-a-day regimen, recommended for most individuals, or a 2,000-milligrams-a-day sodium-restricted diet. Table 8-2 shows some sample amounts of the milligrams of sodium in a single serving of some common soups.

Table 8-2 Canned Soups and Sodium Soups Serving Size Sodium in Milligrams Low Sodium Tomato 1012 ounces 60 (Campbel s) Low Sodium Chicken Broth 1012 ounces 140 (Campbel s) Chicken Broth (Health Val ey) 8 ounces 150 Onion Soup Mix (Lipton) 8 ounces (or 1 tablespoon mix) 610 Lentil (Progresso) 8 ounces 750 Tomato (Campbel s) 4 ounces (condensed soup) 760 (continued) 110 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Table 8-2 (continued) Soups Serving Size Sodium in Milligrams Chicken Broth (Campbel s) 4 ounces (condensed soup) 770 Vegetable Beef (Campbel s) 4 ounces (condensed soup) 890 Chicken Noodle Instant Soup 8 ounces 910 (Knorr) Clam Chowder (Campbel s) 4 ounces (condensed soup) 960 Chunky Beef (Campbel s) 1034 ounces 1,130 For another low-salt stock alternative, you can make a basic vegetable stock by simmering together aromatic vegetables like onion and celery with carrots, which add sweetness, plus some parsley and a bay leaf. You need to cook this mixture for only about 20 minutes.

The classical combination of vegetables (onions, celery, and carrots) is called mirepoix (pronounced meer-pwa). Its a basic beginning for many soups and stocks. When youre chopping mirepoix for stocks, you can roughly chop the vegetables and even skip the peeling if you prefer. But when getting the veggies ready for soups, take the time to prep them as the recipe suggests.

Add strong-flavored vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus, with caution, or theyll overpower the other ingredients. Instead, make a basic stock and add strong-flavored vegetables as you need them for a certain soup.

The Potato-Leek Soup recipe takes advantage of low-sodium chicken broth as stock but is still full of great flavor.

Keeping soup supplies in your pantry Different types of stocks arent the only items you need to have close by when youre craving soup. Keep the following ingredients in your pantry for an impromptu soup-making session:  Canned evaporated milk: Use this item in your creamy soup recipes, such as the Creamy Veggie Lovers Soup later in this chapter.

Evaporated milk is not the same as sweetened condensed milk (a syrupy milk-based concoction with lots of sugar added). Evaporated milk is milk from which 60 percent of the water has been removed. Its concentrated, so it can enhance the flavor of soups and other dishes.

Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 111 Choose regular evaporated milk rather than evaporated skim milk for soups and sauces. Evaporated skim milk has a tendency to curdle and break when heated. If you still want to save the calories, pure the soup with the skim milk before serving.

Canned legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas: Theyre a great source of fiber and protein, but the dried variety can take some time to prepare. So have the canned variety available to toss in a soup pot in a pinch. Get started using these hearty staples in the Indian-Inspired Lamb and Legume Chili later in this chapter.

Always drain and rinse canned beans and vegetables unless the recipe specifies otherwise. This step removes excess sodium, allowing you to season your soup to your preferred taste.

Canned tomatoes: Diced, crushed, whole, or stewed, any of these tomatoes products can make for a quick soup.

Dried herbs and spices. Oregano, basil, pepper, salt, dill, and just about anything in your spice cabinet can work into a soup recipe.

Dried mushrooms: Rehydrate them in hot water, steep them for about 30 minutes, and then strain the liquid to remove any grit. Roughly chop the mushrooms and add the strained liquid for an extra punch of flavor.

Garlic: Garlic adds an amazing flavor to just about anything. You can roast it, saut it, and pure it; whatever works for your soup. Its great in creamy soups, tomato-based soups, or brothy soups. (Not intended for any visiting vampires eating soup, and dont forget the breath mints.)  Grains: Rice, pasta, and barley are great choices to make a soup heart-ier. Check out Chapter 10 for the full story on cooking with grains.

Olive oil: This terrific monounsaturated fat can help make an already nutritious soup heart healthy, too. Keep some on hand at all times.

Onions: These fragrant bulbs add their terrific flavor and aroma to anything you cook.

Potatoes: These starchy veggies cook up quickly and can add body to your soups. Choose them for pured soups as they help thicken soups almost instantly, like in the Potato-Leek Soup earlier in this chapter.

Salt-free seasoning mixes: If you have trouble with high blood pressure, you probably need to steer clear of salt as much as possible. Salt-free seasoning blends can give you many delicious flavor combinations and take the guesswork out of seasoning your soups.

112 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Potato-Leek Soup This soup is great basic comfort food. Leeks (which look sort of like overgrown green onions) must be sliced and then soaked and washed thoroughly to remove dirt and sand deep down in the bulb. Check out Figure 8-1 to see how to cut up a leek. Swish sliced leeks around in a bowl of cold water. Soak them for a few minutes until the dirt and grit settle to the bottom of the bowl. Lift the leeks out of the water and drain on a paper towel. Repeat the procedure again with fresh water.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes Yield: 4 servings Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 large leek, chopped and rinsed (dont use 14 teaspoon pepper the dark green part of leek) 18 teaspoon salt 2 cups potatoes, peeled and cut into 14-inch cubes 1 Coat a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add the leeks. Saut until soft and translucent.

2 Add the potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked. Add the pepper and salt. Continue to simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 113 The U.S. Department of Agricultures Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure adequate intake of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Enjoying a bowl of vegetable soup such as the following recipe is a delicious way to meet your quota.

Classic: Hearty Vegetable Soup When you prepare vegetable soup, first add the items that require longer cooking (such as beets and carrots) and later add quick-cooking ingredients (such as spinach and tomatoes). Youll have all your vegetables just where you want them, done to perfection when your soup is finished. However, this procedure does require your time and attention. Another way to make sure that all the vegetables finish cooking about the same time is to cut the longer-cooking ones (such as potatoes) into smaller pieces and the faster-cooking types (such as squash) into larger chunks.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup diced fresh yucca 18 teaspoon thyme 1 1 1 2 cup diced onions 2 cup diced fresh tomatoes 2 teaspoon oregano 1 1 2 cup diced celery 2 cup diced zucchini 2 cups low-sodium chicken 1 broth 2 cup diced carrots 1 bay leaf 18 teaspoon white pepper 1 Choose a large pot with a tightly fitting lid. Coat the pot with the nonstick spray and cook, stirring constantly, the onions, celery, and carrots until the onions are translucent  about 5 to 7 minutes. You can spray the pot with additional cooking spray or add a little stock or water if the vegetables begin to stick or burn. Add the yucca, tomatoes, zucchini, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, chicken broth, and white pepper and stir to combine.

2 Bring the vegetable soup to a boil over high heat, uncovered, and then simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.

3 Remove the bay leaf and serve immediately as a light lunch or mini meal.

Note : Adding salt is optional, but it does increase the sodium level.

114 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Modifying classic favorites with an international kick Soups are part of every cuisine. And virtually any soup can get a little ethnic flavor by changing the spices and seasonings (all of which are found in most kitchens). In the next recipe, the garam masala, a traditional Indian spice blend, gives this chili a taste of India. You can find this tasty spice blend in the spice section of most grocery stores now. If you want to change the flavors to match another cultures cuisine, change the seasonings.

Try these few ideas to substitute for the garam masala, changing the flavor, but keeping the basic recipe.

Chinese five-spice powder, ground ginger, and a touch of sesame oil stirred in at the end of cooking, for a Chinese-inspired chili  Chili powder and cayenne, for a traditional southwestern chili  Cinnamon, for a Cincinnati-style chili  Basil, marjoram, oregano, thyme, and rosemary, for a taste of Italy  Thyme, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, garlic, and onions, for a little Jamaican jerk flavor  Cumin, coriander seed, and cloves, for a taste of North Africa Indian-Inspired Lamb and Legume Chili This recipe, from food writer Heather Dismore, is an easy one-pot meal thats full of good nutritional benefits. The beans are a wonderful source of dietary fiber, and in this recipe, they meet about a third of your daily fiber needs. Increased fiber can help with blood sugar control as well as enhance satiety, keeping you fuller for longer. Lamb is a good source of iron and vitamin B12, which can both help prevent and improve anemia.

Lamb tends to be a high-fat meat, however, so be sure to drain the fat during the cooking process.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 212 hours (largely unattended) Yield: 8 servings Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 115 112 pounds lean ground lamb 112 teaspoons garam masala 1 cup chopped red onion 14 cup serrano chiles, seeded and minced 3 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 chiles) 2 cans (141 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and 2 ounces each) no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained rinsed 1 cup dry red wine 1 can (15 ounces) lentils, drained and rinsed 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, drained and rinsed 112 teaspoons ground coriander 1 Combine the lamb, onion, and garlic in a large stockpot. Cook over medium heat until the lamb is browned and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Stir as needed. Drain in a colander to remove excess fat. Return drained meat mixture to the stockpot.

2 Stir in the tomatoes, wine, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, and chiles. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and cook 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

3 Stir in the black beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Simmer an additional 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

Creating Creamy Concoctions Who doesnt love a delicious creamy soup? But as you probably know, putting cream in soups adds calories and saturated fat, neither of which are very good for a diabetic diet. If you cant get enough of creamy soups, we have some good news. You can have a great creamy texture  without the stuff you dont need.

One great way to get the creamy texture without the bad stuff is to substitute 2 percent milk for cream in your favorite soups. It gives you plenty of the creaminess and mouth feel you expect because it does have some fat and body, but it cuts the fat grams and calories. Try this great alternative in the following soup recipe.

Contents 116 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Soup, Beautiful Soup 105 T Cauliflower-Parmesan Soup Understanding Soup-Making Basics This recipe comes from Rathbuns in Atlanta (see Appendix A). This soup is warm, hearty, and perfect for a cool day. We substitute 2 percent milk, which has just enough 105 fat to prevent curdling, in place of cream. The 2 percent milk has reduced this soups fat content by nearly 50 percent. Remember to always try to use a lowfat version of dairy products.

This dish is reminiscent of a creamy potato soup, with far fewer calories and starch.

Serving Up Soups with Stocks Cauliflower, a cruciferous vegetable high in vitamin C and fiber, can be a great substitute for potatoes in many traditional recipes. Try using cauliflower next time you are and Other Essentials 109 about to whip up a batch of mashed potatoes. You may be pleasantly surprised not only with the taste but also with the modest effect this dish has on your blood sugar.

Reduce heat to a simmer until the cauliflower is tender, about 35 minutes.

2 Transfer to a blender and pure until smooth (always be extra careful when blending hot liquids), or use a rotary beater to achieve a smooth consistency. While the soup is blending, add the cheese and process until smooth. Finish by adding the lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper.

Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 117 Top your soup with beautiful garnishes to make a simple weeknight supper as delicious for your eyes as it is to your tummy. A few of our favorite fresh garnishes include the following:  Chiffonade basil (see Chapter 9 for an explanation of chiffonade)  Diced red pepper  Finely grated lemon zest  Grated or shaved Parmesan cheese and minced parsley  Julienned radishes, jicama (see Figure 8-2), or daikon radish  A dollop of light sour cream and cilantro  Minced olives  Thinly sliced green onions Figure 8-2: Jicama is a crunchy vegetable with a thin brown skin and white flesh.

Garnish this next creamy soup with Parmesan cheese and minced parsley to add to both the freshness and richness.

Choosing Chilled Soups Chilled soups are great appetizers, light lunches, or even desserts. You can choose any taste (sweet, spicy, savory) or ethnic flavor profile (Latin, Polish, French, you name it), and theres probably a chilled soup to match. Because you serve them cold, theyre great to serve all summer long.

Dont feel like you need to wait for a special occasion to serve these chilled soups. Theyre so easy that you can serve them any time.

Cooling off with veggies Get started with chilled soups by trying this easy Chilled Cucumber Soup.

Spice it up as you see fit. Substitute fresh mint or cilantro for the dill to change the flavor.

120 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Classic: Chilled Cucumber Soup Make cucumber soup even more refreshing by adding naturally tart yogurt. Yogurt, plus the nonfat sour cream in this recipe, makes this soup a substantial and satisfying starter course for lunch or dinner. Or add a punch of lemon zest to create a tangy palate cleanser between courses.

Focusing on fruit Fruit soups are among the most popular chilled soups, probably because people often eat fruit cold. So pureing it first and then eating it isnt a stretch. Fruit soup recipes arent always that simple, but theyre not much tougher. Try cooking fruit soups with that classic blend of strawberries and rhubarb in this next recipe. Watermelon is the star of the other recipe in this section.

122 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Rhubarb Soup with Fresh Strawberries When most people think of rhubarb, not much comes to mind, except for rhubarb pie  and for most people, even that thought rarely occurs! Chef Didier Labbe from the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A) has offered a chilled rhubarb soup recipe for your cooking pleasure. (See the soup in the color section.) This one is a keeper  not only because its delicious, interesting, and different, but also because it packs in more than 100 percent of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C in just one serving! The original recipe calls for sugar to sweeten things up, but we substitute Splenda, and youd never know the difference.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Yield: 2 servings 1 pound rhubarb, peeled and cut into 12-inch- 1 cup water thick slices Juice of 12 lemon 14 cup Splenda 6 mint leaves, julienned 1 pound strawberries, cleaned and sliced 1 In a large mixing bowl, combine the rhubarb and Splenda and mix well. Set the bowl aside.

2 In a saucepan, combine the strawberries, water, and lemon juice. Cover and boil for 5 to 6 minutes. Using a colander, strain the strawberries to obtain just the juice. Discard the pulp.

3 Pour the strawberry juice back into the saucepan and add the rhubarb-and-Splenda mixture. Boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and store the soup in the refrigerator until its cold. Serve the soup chilled with the mint leaves as a garnish.

Tip: Because rhubarb is seasonal, you may need to use the frozen kind, which already comes in pieces.

Chapter 8: Soup, Beautiful Soup 123 T Watermelon Gazpacho Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), delights with this warm weather treat. Just when the dog days of summer really start getting to you, try this refreshing gazpacho. ( Gazpacho is a fancy word for a cold, uncooked soup.) This one takes advantage of the watermelon, one of the seasons most popular fruits and a surprising twist on the usual summertime snack. Not only is this soup cool and invigorat-ing, but its also full of good nutrition. Watermelons are a great source of the antioxidants lycopene, beta carotene, and vitamin C, as well as vitamin A. This soup is quite low in calories, a good thing for your waistline. But before you go for a second scoop, remember that fruit has sugar and should be eaten in moderate amounts.

Preparation time: 45 minutes, plus 1 hour of chilling time Yield: 4 servings 1 cup thinly sliced cucumbers 12 cup small diced celery 1 1 4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 cup finely chopped parsley 6 cups cubed and seeded watermelon (from 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar about a 3-pound seedless watermelon) 2 tablespoons lime juice 12 cup cranberry juice 8 each fresh mint leaves, chiffonade (see 12 cup small diced red bell pepper Chapter 9 for an explanation of chiffonade) 12 cup small diced red onion 1 In a small bowl, toss the cucumbers with the salt.

2 In a blender, add the watermelon and cranberry juice. Pulse until just blended.

(Overblending causes the watermelon to froth and lose its color.) Pour through a sieve into a bowl and press on the pulp to extract all the juice. Discard the pulp.

3 Add the bell pepper, onion, celery, parsley, vinegar, and lime juice to the watermelon juice. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to chill and allow the flavors to blend together.

4 Rinse the cucumbers and pat dry.

5 Ladle the soup into chilled bowls (or martini glasses) and garnish with the cucumber slices and mint.

Feasting on Great Salad Greens Whether greens are an important part of the salad youre making or added just for garnish, using special and novel greens makes your salad stand out.

Skip the pale green iceberg lettuce and buy some darker green lettuces like romaine and leaf lettuce instead (see Figure 9-1 for a sampling). The greener the leaf, the more nutrients it contains, especially magnesium, a mineral important for heart and bone health.

126 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Figure 9-1: A sampling of tasty greens to try for your next salad.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 127 Picking fresh greens at the store When you go shopping, consider picking up some of these types of greens:  Arugula  Boston butter lettuce  Endive  Escarole  Frise  Mizuna  Radicchio  Red leaf lettuce  Romaine  Spinach  Swiss chard  Watercress Store your salad greens in the vegetable bin of your fridge. Store romaine and radicchio with the head intact because the outer leaves keep the inner leaves moist. However, loose-leaf lettuce, like arugula and spinach, has a shorter shelf life. To store this type of lettuce, remove the leaves and wash and drain them. Gather and wrap them in a clean, damp paper towel or two and then store in a plastic bag. The leaves will stay fresh for a couple days, but not much longer.

128 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Grilled Romaine Caesar Salad This delicious recipe is Vegetates (Washington D.C.) take on a classic Caesar salad; they replace the anchovies with toasted, ground nori (seaweed sheets often used for making sushi rolls) and instead of eggs, they use silken tofu, a high protein, cholesterol free improvement.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Chill time: 30 minutes Cook time: 5 minutes Yield: 4 servings 12 sheet toasted nori 1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce 1 package silken tofu Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil 6 romaine hearts 112 ounces lemon juice Grilled bread or croutons (garnish) 2 cloves garlic 1 Grind nori sheet in blender or food processor to a fine powder. Add remaining ingredients (except romaine hearts and garnish) and puree until smooth. Refrigerate dressing for 30 minutes.

2 Meanwhile, wash romaine hearts and slice off ends. Cut each romaine heart in half.

Drizzle each half with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

3 Place each romaine heart face down on hot grill (or grill pan) for 45 seconds or until lightly charred. Remove and serve on chilled plate with drizzled Caesar dressing.

Garnish with grilled bread or croutons.

T Watercress Salad During the summer months, take advantage of all the fresh, seasonal produce that is available. Forget about using iceberg lettuce, which offers nearly nothing in the way of good nutrition. Watercress, on the other hand, is a deep green leafy lettuce that has lots of vitamin A and beta carotene, which is great for eye health. This green leafy vegetable also happens to give you nearly one-fourth of your daily need of calcium, so eat em up for your bones.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 129 We limit the amount of Gorgonzola cheese in this dish, courtesy of Dereks Bistro in Pasadena, California (see Appendix A), in order to keep the calorie and fat levels at an appropriate level. Gorgonzola, however, is a great cheese to use because it lends lots of good flavor in a small amount. Try sticking with sharper cheeses like this one, Parmesan, or cheddar instead of the milder ones  youll need less and get more flavor!

Preparation time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings Vinaigrette dressing: Salad: 12 onion, finely chopped 2 small Granny Smith apples 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 8 cups watercress, rinsed, destemmed and 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano patted dry (purchase ready-to-use watercress if time is limited) 14 cup canola oil 4 ounces Gorgonzola blue cheese, crumbled 14 cup sherry vinegar 1 Salt and pepper 2 cup roasted pecans (see the tip at the end of the recipe) 1 To prepare the vinaigrette, place the onion, thyme, and oregano into a large bowl. Add the canola oil and sherry vinegar. Whisk the mixture together until everything is well combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.

2 Prepare the apples just before ready to serve to maintain their freshness and color.

Leaving the skin on, slice the apples in half and core them. Julienne (slice into long strips) the cored apples.

3 Place the watercress in a large bowl and add the dressing. (You may not need all the dressing, so add carefully to taste.) Dish onto four plates and sprinkle the blue cheese and pecans over the greens. Arrange the apples on top and serve.

Tip: To prepare the roasted pecans, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread out the pecans in one even layer. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake for 10 minutes and then remove from the baking sheet. Set aside to cool.

130 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Fresh Mushroom Salad This dish from Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A) truly glorifies the mushroom  and the praise is well-deserved. Mushrooms are a popular and versatile vegetable with numerous health benefits. Theyre a great source of dietary fiber as well as many of the B vitamins, which can help support good energy levels.

Restaurant owner Laura Maioglio says that this salad, traditionally of Piemonte, Italy, is made with wild porcini mushrooms and white truffles. If you cant obtain fresh porcini, cultivated cremini mushrooms still give you a delicious salad. During truffle season at Barbetta, the salad is served with white truffles hunted by the restaurants own truffle hounds! Drizzled on top of the mushrooms is the quite luxurious porcini olive oil in which porcini mushrooms steep their flavor into the oil as they sit together. Making your own olive oil can save you money because it costs a bundle in the specialty food stores!

Preparation time: 20 minutes, plus several days for steeping the olive oil Yield: 4 servings 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms 1 bunch oak leaf lettuce 1 quart extra-virgin olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 10 ounces fresh porcini mushrooms Salt and pepper 1 bunch Lolla Rossa lettuce (or substitute red leaf lettuce) 1 Prepare your own porcini olive oil by steeping the dried porcini mushrooms in the olive oil. Let stand a few days for the oil to acquire the flavor of the mushrooms. Save the oil you dont need in this recipe for future use to give any number of dishes a fabulous taste.

2 Put 8 mushrooms aside and slice the remaining mushrooms very thin.

3 On 4 medium-size plates, place a few leaves of Lolla Rossa over a few oak leaf lettuce leaves. Place 1 whole mushroom on either side of the lettuce leaves to look as if the mushrooms are growing between the lettuce leaves. Place the sliced mushrooms in the remaining space on the plate.

4 Drizzle the porcini olive oil and lemon juice over the mushrooms and lettuce, and salt and pepper to taste.

Tip: Drizzle your extra porcini olive oil on steamed or roasted veggies, add a touch of it to risotto during the final stages of cooking, or use it to give a punch of flavor to a marinade.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 131 Boning up on bagged salad blends Fortunately, produce manufacturers are taking convenience foods to a healthy level for a change. Look in your produce section for prewashed, ready-to-use salad greens and blends. You can open a bag and have a delicious meal in a matter of minutes. For super easy and quick salads, pick up prewashed salad blends like these:  American blend: This familiar blend usually includes iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, radish slices, and red cabbage.

European blend: Its a great mix to try if your salad experience stops at iceberg lettuce. It includes mild green leaf lettuce, romaine, iceberg, curly endive, and a bit of radicchio. It goes well with just about any dressing, toasted nuts, and any kind of cheese, including blue cheese and goat cheese.

Italian blend: This blend is terrific for simple protein-based salads, light Caesar dressing, or a traditional Italian vinaigrette. It usually consists of a blend of romaine and radicchio.

Spring mix: This tasty mixture is a staple at most fine restaurants. Its usually a blend of baby greens that include baby spinach, radicchio, and frise. It may also be called mesclun, spring greens, or field greens. It makes a gorgeous garnish or bed for serving fresh fish or steak.

Different manufacturers call different mixes by different trademarked names.

Many blends also include other veggies, like radishes, carrots, and even snow peas. All blends should include a description or listing of the greens (and other tasty veggies) included in their package, so find what suits your fancy and get munching!

Although these salad greens blends are great, many manufacturers also sell salad kits, which include the salad greens, dressing, cheese, and croutons.

Watch the fat and unnecessary calories that these convenience kits can provide. And remember, you dont have to eat it just because it comes in the kit.

Feel free to toss that full-fat Caesar dressing in the trash.

Growing your own greens Growing fresh baby greens is incredibly simple, no matter where you live.

Their shallow root systems make them ideal for indoor gardening. All you need is a shallow bowl or planter, high-quality potting soil, lettuce seeds, and a nice sunny window.

132 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Heres how you do it: 1. Fill a shallow container that has good drainage with high-quality potting soil.

2. Gently press seeds into the soil.

Because youll be harvesting your baby greens when theyre, well, babies, you dont need to space out the seeds. Go ahead and just sprinkle them around rather than make nice neat rows.

3. Water your seeds.

Keep the seeds moist but not soggy. Light but frequent watering produces the best leafy greens.

4. Set the container in a sunny window.

Most greens germinate, or sprout seeds, within a few weeks. Feel free to start harvesting when the greens are a few inches tall. Just trim off what you need with kitchen shears.

To keep a constant supply of greens on hand, sow a second container two weeks later. Use a mixture of different seeds to create your own spring mix.

For more information on growing lettuce or other vegetables in containers, check out Container Gardening For Dummies, by Bill Marken and the editors of the National Gardening Association, published by Wiley.

Creating sensational homemade dressings Until very recently, bottled salad dressings didnt offer much in the way of flavor unless they were full of fat, salt, sugar, and other no-nos for a diabetic diet. Some of the newer light dressings have improved flavor, are less detri-mental to your health, and are convenient. But theres really no substitute for making dressings yourself. And believe it or not, the process is pretty simple.

To make basic diabetic-friendly vinaigrette, follow these steps: 1. Measure equal parts oil (usually extra-virgin olive oil), acid (like balsamic vinegar or lemon juice), and stock (like low-sodium chicken stock) and whisk them together.

2. Blend desired herbs and seasonings into the dressing and whisk some more.

To add a truly professional touch, combine all your ingredients (except the oil) in a food processor or blender. With the appliance running, slowly pour the oil into the other ingredients. The dressing will emulsify, or blend, really well.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 133 T Truffle Vinaigrette Chef Vitaly Paley from Paleys Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), uses truffles in this vinaigrette to create a truly luxurious, distinct flavor. Truffles are similar to mushrooms in that theyre actually a fungus  but dont let that fool you; theyre simply wonderful. You can find truffles at most fine food stores  theyre worth search-ing for. You can drizzle this vinaigrette atop steamed vegetables or mixed greens.

Often, a simple dressing is best. Steeping herbs, garlic, and dried mushrooms in oil gives you an excellent base to make your own tasty dressings. Add a little acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, and youre on your way.

Going Beyond Greens with Tomatoes For many people, salad and lettuce are synonymous. While salad greens are amazingly nutritious, its fun to try your hand at other salads that highlight other terrific vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers. Flavor them up with other extras, such as toasted nuts and freshly made dressings, and you have a great alternative to a traditional salad. For another great salad without greens, check out the Olive and Lentil Salad in Chapter 10.

Pecans T Summer Tomato Salad Although summertime is great for vibrantly red, juicy, sweet tomatoes, you can enjoy them year-round  and should! Tomatoes are packed with lycopene and beta carotene, two antioxidants known for their disease-fighting capabilities. This dish, courtesy of Paleys Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A) and shown in the color section, is low in saturated fat and contains no cholesterol but still remains intense in flavor from the fresh basil and garlic. In all your cooking, try using fresh herbs and spices for flavoring instead of high-fat spreads and salt.

Adding Fresh Fruit to Your Salad Everyone knows how refreshing fruit salad can taste, made with three or four of the seasons best crops. But in a diabetic diet, fruit, which is full of natural and easily absorbed sugars, needs to be enjoyed in moderation. How can you still include the juicy pleasures of fruit in a diabetic diet? By creating meals with small amounts of fruit and combining it with other foods, as in the following Fig, Mozzarella, and Mizuna Salad. Figs, mozzarella, and olive oil combine to balance the fat, protein, and carbohydrates.

136 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Fig, Mozzarella, and Mizuna Salad with Thai Basil Tante Maries cooking school provides this recipe thats a great combination of sweet and savory. The quick and elegant presentation makes this salad a natural for entertaining.

Mizuna is a Japanese mustard green. Its leaves are shaped much like dandelion leaves, but are more subtle and delicate, with a jagged edge, and a mild earthy flavor. Its a great lettuce to grow yourself, so if you cant find it in a gourmet grocery store near you, consider growing your own with the instructions later in this chapter.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings 8 green figs 13 cup fruity extra-virgin olive oil 12 small balls of fresh mozzarella 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 bunch or 12 ounces mizuna or arugula Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1 bunch or 4 ounces Thai basil or purple mint 1 Wash the figs and remove the little stems with a paring knife. Remove the mozzarella balls from their liquid. Wash the greens; drain thoroughly. Remove basil (or mint if using) leaves from the stems. Wash the herbs; pat the leaves dry.

2 Place the greens and herbs in a medium bowl and toss with the olive oil.

3 Pile the greens mixture in the middle of four dinner plates. Using your thumbs, gently pull figs in half and lay them open-side up around the greens mixture on the plates.

Arrange 3 balls of cheese around the greens pile on each plate well.

4 Sprinkle each plate with a little extra olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice, and a sprinkle of coarse salt. Grind fresh pepper to taste over each salad.

Blood Orange, Beet, and Avocado Salad In this recipe I recommend using pale colored beets because the deep red beets I used when testing the recipe turned everything dark red. This recipe is a mixture of some of our favorite fruits and vegetables.

Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour or more Yield: 6 servings Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 137 1 head red lettuce (or a small bag of mesclun) Coarse salt 4 blood oranges 112 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 bunch yellow beets 3 tablespoons good quality extra virgin olive oil 2 avocados freshly ground black pepper, to taste 14 cup shelled pistachios or toasted pine nuts 1 Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2 Cut the leaves and roots from the beets. Rub them with olive oil and wrap each in foil.

Bake beets until soft when pierced with a fork, at least 1 hour. When the beets are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and cut the beets into wedges.

3 Meanwhile, wash and dry the lettuce and place it in a large bowl.

4 Cut both ends off the oranges, lay them on a cut side, and with a knife, remove the rind in 1-inch strips around the orange, cutting down to the flesh. Squeeze any excess juice from the cuttings over the lettuce. Cut the skinned oranges into rounds.

5 Cut each avocado in half, and cut the flesh of each half into slices.

6 Arrange the blood orange slices, the avocado slices, and the beets over the lettuce.

Sprinkle with pistachios or pine nuts.

7 When ready to serve, mix a scant half teaspoon of salt in the bowl of a spoon with the vinegar. Toss vinegar mixture over the salad, then add the olive oil and pepper to taste.

Toss salad gently so that all the ingredients are lightly coated with dressing. Arrange salad on individual salad plates.

Chapter 9: Taking Salads Seriously 139 The typical Asian diet is getting a lot of attention in the media as being a healthy one. In general, Asian populations tend to have less incidence of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Their diets tend to focus on seafood as the main protein; plant-based foods, like soy products and rice, rather than dairy products; and tons of vegetables. The following recipe gives you a chance to sample the flavors of this healthful cuisine.

Teriyaki Salmon Salad Salmon, natures wonder food, is full of those omega-3 fatty acids, one of the good fats.

Canned legumes, like chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and kidney beans, are an excellent and inexpensive way to make sure youre getting enough protein. Plus these protein powerhouses are cholesterol free, making them an all-around excellent choice.

Cultivated by early farmers, they helped my ancestors become settled, non-nomadic peoples, building stable civilizations the world over. We owe a lot to these little packets of nutrition, like rice and quinoa.

146 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Eating rice the right way Rice is a worldwide staple, but it often gets a bad reputation because so many people eat the bland, processed white rice slathered with fat-heavy sauces.

Instead, try less processed, flavored rice that can stand on its own or can be enhanced by a few simple seasonings or cooking techniques. And always remember to eat in moderation.

Here are a few rice varieties that may be new to you with ideas on how to use them:  Arborio: Its an Italian short- to medium-grained rice used in making risotto. The rice gives off starches as it cooks to add to the creaminess of this popular Italian dish. Try it for yourself in the recipe for Risotto alle Erbe Made with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil in this section.

Basmati: Its name means queen of fragrance for its distinct nutty aroma during cooking. Its fragrance is enhanced as its aged after harvesting. True basmati rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas, but a few new basmati-like varieties are grown in the United States under the names Texmati and Kasmati.

Brown: This rice has the whole rice grain intact, with only the inedible outer husk removed. Because it has the bran coating intact, its higher in fiber but has a shorter shelf life (around six months). Use it in any recipe that calls for white rice, but give it a bit more time to cook (about 45 minutes). To get started with it, try the Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf in this section.

Jasmine: Aromatic long-grain rice from Thailand, this rice is highly prized but less expensive than basmati. Try it out in the Black Bean Pie recipe later in this chapter.

Long-grain: A broad category of rice, long-grain rice has long, evenly shaped pieces that tend to be drier and less starchy than short-grained varieties. Long-grain rice separates easily after cooking. Basmati, jasmine, and wild rice are all long-grain rices.

Medium-grain: As the name implies, medium-grain rice is longer than short-grain rice and shorter than long-grain rice.

Short-grain: This rice has short, almost round grains and a higher starch content than long-grain rice, giving it a sticky, clumpy consistency after cooking.

Wild rice: This rice is actually the grain of a wild marsh grass. It has a chewy texture and nutty flavor. Its often combined with other rice.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 147 Middle Eastern Brown Rice Pilaf Sometimes people complain that brown rice never seems to taste right or it just never achieves a good consistency. Here is a dish, contributed by food writer and For Dummies author Heather Dismore, that uses this whole grain and incorporates many other textures and flavors that will leave you loving brown rice forever! This is a good lesson in creativity and risk taking! Seek out new and different recipes that change the flavors until you find one you like. If you hesitate to try brown rice again, try this recipe before you swear off this healthy food forever.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour Yield: 6 servings 2 tablespoons olive oil 34 cup uncooked brown rice 112 cups chopped onion 2 cups chicken broth 1 clove garlic, minced 14 cup chopped fresh green onions 2 carrots, sliced Salt and pepper 2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms 1 Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Saut the onions, stirring frequently until they soften. Add the garlic and carrots and continue stirring for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and rice and cook until the mushrooms soften, about 7 to 8 minutes.

2 Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat. Continue cooking until all the liquid is absorbed, approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Toss with the green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

148 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Risotto alle Erbe Made with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Here is a wonderful risotto dish offered to us from Barbetta restaurant in New York (see Appendix A). Important to note is the importance of stirring the risotto constantly! This is not a moment for TV watching or telephone answering! The risotto at the end should be smooth and flowing, and once done, you must eat it immediately. This saying in Italy tells the story: You must wait for risotto, but risotto cannot wait for you.

Making risotto with olive oil was first introduced by Barbetta Restaurant and certainly is a healthy change from the traditional method, which calls for butter. Essentially, risotto is made from Italian rice, and for people with diabetes, rice has falsely been accused of being bad food. Too many carbs, and for that matter, too much of anything is bad, but this risotto dish, served in moderation, can certainly be part of a balanced, healthy diet. Its absolutely delicious and worth every bite. Pair the risotto with some protein, such as fish or poultry, and fiber, from nonstarchy veggies, to keep your blood sugars on an even keel.

Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Yield: 6 servings (1 cup each) 1 bunch fresh sage 1 teaspoon salt 1 bunch fresh rosemary Pinch of pepper 1 bunch fresh parsley 1 cup Italian rice, Carnaroti or arborio 1 bunch fresh basil 1 cup dry white wine 11 1 2 quarts water 2 cup grated Parmigiano cheese 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided Salt and pepper 12 medium onion, finely chopped 1 From the fresh sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil, chop enough in equal parts (roughly 3 tablespoons) of each type of herb to make 34 cup. Set aside.

2 Using butchers twine, tie together one stem each of sage, rosemary, parsley, and basil (once tied together, the herbs resemble a bouquet of flowers). Place the bouquet in a saucepan with the 112 quarts of water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Allow the bouquet to steep for 30 minutes. Strain and keep warm. This will serve as your herb stock.

Bring stock back to a low simmer before adding to risotto in Step 5.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 149 3 In a 3-quart saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.

4 Add the chopped onions, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Add the rice, wine, and chopped herbs. Immediately stir and continue to stir every 15 seconds until the risotto absorbs the wine. Keep the heat medium to high.

5 When the wine has evaporated, begin to add simmering stock 12 cup at time, stirring continuously. Add a bit of salt and pepper depending on your taste. Once 12 cup of the stock is absorbed and the rice looks dry, add another 12 cup. Repeat until youve added roughly 3 to 4 cups of the herb stock, and the rice is soft but al dente, or firm to the bite. If the rice tastes hard and starchy, continue adding stock. This step takes about 25 to 30 minutes total. Note: You must continue to stir the risotto during this stage of cooking. Stirring helps to bring out the starchy creaminess in the rice and ensures the proper texture and consistency.

6 Once the risotto is cooked, its consistency should resemble thick oatmeal. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the grated Parmigiano cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Stir very well. Allow to rest 2 minutes. Stir once more before serving. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

150 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Pumpkin Risotto This recipe for Pumpkin Risotto, from Tante Maries Cooking School in San Francisco, is a celebration of the fall produce harvest. It calls for pumpkin, but you can substitute butternut, acorn, or other firm-fleshed squash for twist.

Weve listed nutritional information for 6 entre servings, but you could instead create 12 side-dish portions to serve as a side with Thanksgiving dinner, replacing mashed potatoes or another starchy side dish. One added healthy benefit: Because this risotto is so delicious, you wont need the gravy that bland starches beg for.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 45 minutes Yield: 6 servings 6 to 7 cups of low-sodium vegetable broth 12 cup dry white wine 14 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage 1 3 1 4 cups Arborio rice 2 teaspoon salt 11 1 2 cups peeled, seeded and diced fresh 4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper pumpkin 14 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 In a medium-large saucepan, heat the vegetable broth to a simmer over medium heat.

Maintain simmer throughout the other steps.

2 In a separate 3-quart heavy saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

Toss in the rice and diced pumpkin and stir with a wooden spoon until the rice is coated with the oil.

3 Add the white wine to the rice mixture and stir constantly until all the wine has been absorbed. Ladle 12 cup of hot broth into the pan and stir until it is absorbed. Continue with rest of the broth, adding 12 cup at a time and letting each addition be absorbed completely by the rice before adding more liquid.

Remember: The constant stirring allows the rice to release its starch into the cooking liquid, resulting in the characteristic risotto creaminess.

4 When the rice is creamy and cooked through but still firm, or al dente, (roughly about 25 to 30 minutes stirring time), stir in the sage, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 151 Kicking it up with quinoa Quinoa (pronounced ke-n wh) is considered by some to be the most nutritious of all the whole grains (see Figure 10-1). This ancient superfood is becoming more popular, showing up on the menus of gourmet restaurants nationwide. Quinoa is high in protein and fiber, provides 25 percent of your daily iron needs, and is a tremendous source of magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. It is more nutritious than white rice and in most dishes can be substituted for the more popular grain.

Most mainstream grocery stores carry it these days, but if you have trouble tracking it down, try your local health food store. Whenever possible, opt for the grain itself, rather than a processed boxed quinoa pilaf. As with other grains, the less processed the better.

Always rinse quinoa thoroughly before cooking it. Dont be tempted to skip this step. Even if your quinoa is processed, which removes much of the sapo-nin or protective outer covering, the dust still remains. It can add a nasty bitter flavor to your finished dish. Dont risk it. Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer. Run cold water through the grains until the water runs clear. Drain the water off, stir the grains around a bit, and then re-rinse to ensure youve removed all the bitter outer coating.

Figure 10-1: Quinoa is a terrific source of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

152 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Moroccan Quinoa Moroccan spices, like turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon, combine with almonds and dried fruits to give this quinoa a delicious North African flavor. Heather Dismore contributed this recipe to keep your taste buds perky and your blood sugar stable. Its a great way to get started with quinoa if you havent already discovered this amazing grain.

156 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Trying out barley Barley is a whole grain that is a delicious side dish to serve with meats and poultry. Try the following recipe to include some barley in your diet.

Classic: Barley Pilaf Barley that still retains the bran takes a long time to cook, so manufacturers pearl the barley, which means they remove the bran. Pearled barley is the kind you usually find in supermarkets. Look for barley with grains that are oval, not round, a sign that the bran is mostly intact. In comparison with rice and wheat, barley has significantly less effect on blood glucose. Barley is also tasty added to soups.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 50 minutes Yield: 6 servings 1 piece smoked ham hock, 6 ounces 4 cups water 2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch lengths 1 tablespoon safflower oil 2 bay leaves 1 medium onion, chopped 12 teaspoon dried sage 1 cup pearled barley Pepper 1 In a large pot, put the ham hock, celery, bay leaves, sage, pepper to taste, and water.

Over high heat, bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Volume of the broth will reduce by about 1 cup.

2 In a medium pot, heat the safflower oil over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the barley and cook, stirring for 1 minute.

3 When the ham hock stock is prepared, pour the broth through a sieve into the barley.

Bring to a boil.

4 Turn the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook the barley until tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. If the barley is not quite done, add 1 or 2 tablespoons water and continue to cook. If the barley is cooked but liquid remains, turn off heat and let the barley rest in the covered pot while the grain continues to absorb the liquid.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 157 Preparing Perfect Pasta Pasta comes in many shapes and sizes (see Figure 10-2 for a sampling). Here are some guidelines to help you decide what works for your recipe:  For lighter, brothy sauces and pestos, choose delicate, long pasta, like vermicelli, spaghetti, linguine, or angel hair.

For meatier, chunkier sauces or pasta salads, choose shorter shapes with ridges or holes, like cavatelli, penne, farfalle, and wagon wheels.

The smaller pieces make it easier to grab pasta and sauce with every bite. And the ridges and holes in the pasta grab bits and chunks of your sauce.

For heavier and creamier sauces, choose flat, ribbonlike pasta, such as fettuccine.

Most pasta is made from semolina flour, not refined white flour. Its a complex carbohydrate, rather than a simple carbohydrate, meaning that it gives your body more lasting energy and a more gradual release of sugar. A 12 cup serving of cooked pasta contains 99 calories, less than half a gram of fat, and less than 5 milligrams of sodium, and it costs you only 1 starch exchange.

Here are a few other benefits of choosing pasta.

It has a relatively low glycemic index of 41. For more about the glycemic index and how it can help you manage your blood glucose levels, check out Chapter 2.

Its a quick food to prepare. You can get this filling side dish ready in about 10 minutes.

It goes with just about anything. Pasta is so versatile. You can toss it with chicken broth and fresh herbs, or fresh veggies and a little bit of olive oil. If you can cook it, you can serve it with pasta.

Create Chinese flavored dishes with a splash of sesame oil, crunchy water chestnuts, bok choy, and cilantro. Add thinly sliced beef for a full meal.

Mix up a Mediterranean delight by adding tomatoes, garlic, and fresh basil. Throw in some pine nuts and seafood for a lowfat, tasty weeknight supper.

Invent your own Latin lunch, by including grilled onions, chicken breast, chiles, and chayote squash.

Introduce flavors from the Caribbean by tossing pasta with shrimp, flaked coconut, jerk seasonings, and vegetable stock.

Work in some Vietnamese inspired cuisine, by adding it to vegetable broth, chopped chiles, cilantro, and lean pork.

158 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great  Its very filling. A 12 cup serving may not seem like much, but a little can go a long way, especially if you bulk up the fiber content of your dish with fresh veggies. Or opt for 2 starch servings, and have a full cup of pasta and enjoy it as a main course.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 159 T Classic: Butterfly Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Artichoke Hearts The few ingredients that this simple recipe calls for complement each other perfectly, as you can see from the photo in the color section. The dish is a certified crowd pleaser, full of color and flavor and ideal for entertaining. The pasta is best served at room temperature, so you can make it hours in advance, freeing you for the last-minute details of throwing a party.

Preparation time: 15 minutes (plus overnight marinating time) Cooking time: 10 minutes Yield: 4 servings 2 ounces sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 1 jar (15 ounces) marinated artichoke hearts, 1 drained 2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 8 ounces butterfly pasta 1 Salt and pepper (optional) 2 cup finely chopped basil leaves, plus extra whole leaves for garnish Grated Parmesan cheese (optional) 1 In a shallow bowl, combine the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and basil. Let rest overnight to allow the tomatoes to rehydrate.

2 Transfer the tomato mixture to a large bowl and add the artichoke hearts. Lightly toss together.

3 Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook the pasta according to the directions on the package until the pasta is al dente, cooked but not soft. Drain and add to the tomato artichoke mixture. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

4 Serve at room temperature, garnished with whole basil leaves and Parmesan cheese on the side, if desired.

The Italians have even figured out how to use the black ink of octopus in one special pasta dish. This recipe is much tamer, however. Its a low-calorie but quite satisfy- Relishing Rice and ing combination of seafood and pasta. Using farfalle, pasta shaped like a butterfly or a bow tie, adds eye appeal. If you have access to a specialty Italian food market, you may even be able to find farfallini, the smallest butterflies, or farfallone, the largest.

Although most of the pasta youll find in your local grocery is made from semolina flour, you can find pasta made from a variety of different flours, including these:  Brown rice: This pasta is a great alternative for people allergic to wheat.

Check the label, but most brown rice pasta is both wheat and gluten free. They may also be dairy-free and organic. Try this delicious pasta in the following recipe.

Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 161  Soy: Pasta made with soy flour tends to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate than semolina pasta, but always read the label to make sure youre making the right choice for your needs.

Whole wheat: If youre looking for a higher fiber pasta, whole-wheat pasta may be what youre looking for. Its characterized by a more robust flavor than its semolina counterpart.

T Classic: Kasha and Brown Rice Pasta Sometimes simple food, such as this delicious combination of kasha and pasta, tastes the best. Kasha is buckwheat groats (hulled and crushed buckwheat). The flavors are mellow and nutty with just a hint of mushroom, a step beyond blandness but still quiet comfort food. This mixture is meant to be a background dish, served with savory foods such as a chicken roasted with herbs or slow-cooked flank steak prepared with onion and dried fruits. This merger of whole grains and pasta is especially favored in Eastern European and Russian cooking.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes Yield: 6 servings 2 teaspoons safflower oil 2 cups boiling vegetable broth or water 1 medium onion, chopped Pepper 1 egg, slightly beaten Sea salt (optional) 1 cup kasha (buckwheat groats) 4 cups water 12 cup sliced button mushrooms 112 cups brown rice rotini (Lundberg brand) 1 In a heavy medium saucepan, heat the oil and saut the onion until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.

2 Beat the egg in a small bowl. Add the kasha and mix together, coating each grain with the egg. Add to the onions. Cook the kasha while stirring until the grains are dry and separated.

3 Add the mushrooms, broth, pepper, and sea salt, if desired. Cover the skillet and simmer until all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.

4 In the meantime, bring the 4 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add the rotini and cook for 6 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Drain and, if necessary, keep warm while the kasha finishes cooking.

5 When the kasha is fully cooked, fluff with a fork and stir in the rotini.

162 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Letting Legumes into Your Diet Legumes (pronounced LAY-gooms) are the protein-packed staple of a vegetarian diet, but you dont have to swear off meat to enjoy them. The family of grains includes thousands of plant species, including beans, soybeans, lentils, peas, and the beloved peanut.

Its tough to find a more perfect all-round food than legumes. Theyre rich in protein, low in fat (what fat they do have is the good fat), high in dietary fiber, and rich in complex carbohydrates and vitamins. Besides being healthy, theyre inexpensive, very versatile, and easy to use. They store well when dried, and have a shelf life of a full year.

Because legumes are also high in carbohydrate, a person with diabetes still needs to be mindful of portion sizes here. The benefits that the fiber and protein provide, however, make them a more optimal choice than the usual carbs like bread, pasta, or rice.

Red-Wine-Braised Lentils This recipe, courtesy of Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), is an easy accompaniment to any poultry or meat dish. The hearty lentils are flavored by the slow-cooked method of braising in which they begin to achieve the flavor of the red wine.

Lentils are a complex carbohydrate full of fiber, as well as a good source of protein.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour and 20 minutes Yield: 6 servings 1 tablespoon butter 2 ounces diced prosciutto 2 tablespoons olive oil 18 cup dried porcini mushrooms, reconstituted 1 cup diced onions and sliced (see the tip at the end of the recipe) 1 112 cups red wine 2 cup chopped celery 1 2 cups dried brown lentils 2 cup diced carrots Salt and pepper 1 bay leaf 1 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 teaspoon thyme leaves Chapter 10: Stocking Up on Grains and Legumes 163 1 In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil. Saut the onions, celery, and carrots, until they begin to sweat, or give off a bit of liquid. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste and cover the pot. Cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately 10 minutes.

2 Add the thyme, prosciutto, and dried porcini mushrooms. Add the wine and reduce by one-third. Add the lentils, bay leaf, and chicken broth and simmer for about 1 hour, until the lentils are soft.

3 Remove the bay leaf. Adjust the salt and pepper if needed. This dish may be refriger-ated for up to 3 days, until ready to use.

Tip: To reconstitute the dried porcini mushrooms, place them in 14 cup hot water for 30 minutes, chop them, and strain the liquid. If you want, you can use the liquid as part of the cooking liquid. Just substitute the mushroom broth for 14 cup of the chicken broth in Step 2.

Lentils are quick cooking legumes, so you dont need to soak them before cooking like you do with dried beans. If youre extra conscientious, feel free to pick over the lentils, as you would with dried beans. Rinse them well to remove any dirt or other debris. Then sort through them a handful at a time, looking for dirt clods, stones, and other foreign particles. Try them in soups, saucy Indian curries, or this terrific salad.

164 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Olive and Lentil Salad This dish, from Heather Dismore, is considered a salad, but dont let that word fool you! This dish is unlike many salads  its hearty and will keep you full and satisfied for a long time. This olive and lentil mix has a ton of fiber and protein (from the lentils) and enough heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (from the olives) that will digest slowly and therefore keep you feeling full for longer. It has only a moderate amount of carbohydrates, so your blood sugars wont be hugely affected here. This one-pot meal offers you a significant amount of iron, calcium, folate, and vitamins A, C, and B6.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 40 minutes Yield: 6 servings Salad: 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano 1 cup dry lentils Salt and pepper 2 bay leaves 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1 sprig fresh thyme Dressing: 1 carrot, finely chopped 14 cup red wine vinegar 1 stalk celery, finely chopped 2 tablespoons green olive juice 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 tablespoon minced shallot 1 tablespoon minced garlic 3 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and sliced thinly 1 teaspoon salt 12 yellow bell pepper, diced 1 teaspoon pepper 1 jar (8 ounces) green olives, roughly chopped 14 cup olive oil (reserve juice for the dressing) 1 In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the lentils, bay leaves, thyme, carrots, celery, shallots, and garlic. Cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a low boil and cook until the lentils are just tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.

2 After the lentils have cooled, add the tomatoes, peppers, olives, and oregano. Mix thoroughly. Salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the goat cheese.

3 In a blender, combine the vinegar, olive juice, shallot, mustard, salt, and pepper.

Remove the knob from the lid of the blender. With the blender running, slowly pour in the olive oil to emulsify the dressing. Adjust seasonings as necessary. Pour over the salad and toss gently to coat.

Beans offer a tremendous amount of fiber, more specifically soluble fiber  the type that can lower your LDL, or bad cholesterol. Because theyre plant based, they have no cholesterol.

T White Beans and Spinach Beans are part of the standard diet of almost every culture, and the Italians are no exception. Heather Dismore contributed this recipe that uses the cannellini beans, an Italian staple, paired with nutritious vitamin-A-rich spinach.

Prepare the following elegant recipe for your family or guests, and everyone will be so pleasantly surprised  especially when you tell them the rich, savory sauce has barely any fat.

T Broccoli with Creamy Lemon Sauce Who doesnt love broccoli and cheese? And for most of us, the more cheese the better!

And whats even better, you can enjoy this one (courtesy of food writer Heather Dismore) guilt-free. This creamy sauce is made with mainly lowfat ingredients instead of the full-fat dairy products that usually go into rich sauces. Just be sure not to add any more salt. The cottage cheese and Parmesan already contribute enough for flavor.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 35 minutes Yield: 6 servings 2 1 3 cup lowfat cottage cheese 8 teaspoon ground turmeric 14 cup evaporated skim milk White pepper 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 3 cups hot cooked broccoli florets 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, milk, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, turmeric, and white pepper to taste and pure until the mixture achieves a thin consistency, about 30 seconds.

2 Heat the sauce in a skillet, stirring occasionally, until heated through, but do not boil.

3 Serve the sauce over the warm broccoli.

172 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Zucchini and Parmigiano-Reggiano Salad This recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. Chef Kevin Rathbun of Rathbuns in Atlanta (see Appendix A) uses simple, quality ingredients like Parmigiano-Reggiano (the original and best Parmesan cheese in the world), extra-virgin olive oil, and fresh lemon juice to give this dish rich flavors with very little effort.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings 3 medium zucchini, peeled and sliced 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 1 2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved thin 2 teaspoon pepper 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped lemon verbena 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Place the zucchini in a bowl and shave the Parmigiano-Reggiano in the bowl. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and verbena. Toss to incorporate the ingredients and serve.

Tip: Lemon verbena is a potent herb, with a strong lemon flavor. Look for it in specialty food markets. Alternatively, look for it at your local nursery and grow your own. If you cant find it, you can always pick another herb (like tarragon or basil). The substitution will change the flavor but will still be delicious.

Enhancing natural flavors with dry steaming Dry steaming refers to cooking vegetables in their own natural juices rather than adding additional moisture. In the case of carrots, they have a medium to high moisture content, so when you heat them in a closed environment (like in a pot with a tight-fitting lid), they use the liquid that they give off during the cooking process to create steam and facilitate the cooking process. So the food is essentially steamed without adding any water. You get a similar effect when you microwave vegetables without adding water.

Dont microwave vegetables, or anything else, in a completely closed container. Always provide a vent of some sort for steam to escape.

174 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Dry-Steamed Dilled Carrots Heres a tasty twist on a veggie favorite. Heather Dismore uses fresh herbs here to give these carrots a new and interesting flavor. Carrots are one of the best sources of vitamin A, antioxidants, lutein, and beta carotene. These are the nutrients best known for eye health. The orange fruits and vegetables are all good sources of these antioxidants, so get them in whenever you can!

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes Yield: 12 servings 2 tablespoons butter 14 cup minced fresh dill 1 pound baby carrots Salt and pepper 1 Melt the butter in a deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add the carrots. Cook over medium to medium-low heat for approximately 35 to 40 minutes. Shake the skillet occasionally during cooking, without removing the lid.

2 Remove the lid after 35 to 40 minutes and check to confirm that carrots are tender.

Allow any excess moisture to evaporate from the skillet. Toss the carrots with the dill.

Salt and pepper to taste.

Blanching vegetables for optimum taste and nutrition Blanching is a terrific technique for cooking vegetables without losing many of the vitamins that make them so healthy for you. Its also surprisingly simple. You immerse vegetables in boiling water, leave them in the water for a short period of time, and then shock them, or immerse them in ice-cold water to stop the cooking. This technique helps to prevent the vegetables from getting mushy. Check out Figure 11-1 to see the basic steps.

Here are the detailed steps to follow for blanching vegetables.

1. Bring salted water to vigorous boil in a 2-quart saucepan.

2. While the water is working up to a boil, prepare the ice bath.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 175 Fill a medium-sized mixing bowl one-half to three-fourths full with ice.

Add water to just cover the ice.

3. Blanch the vegetables.

Place the trimmed vegetables, in batches if necessary, in the boiling water. Cook the vegetables until theyre crisp tender.

You want to keep a constant boil, but adding too many veggies at a time can slow down the process.

4. Shock the vegetables.

Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and immediately place them in the ice bath. Remove them from the ice bath after the vegetables are completely cooled, usually 1 to 2 minutes.

To check for doneness, remove a single vegetable piece with a slotted spoon; submerge it in the ice bath until its cool enough to place in your mouth. Then actually taste it to check the texture. Do this step quickly so that if the veggies are ready, the rest of them in the boiling water wont overcook while youre testing.

5. Reheat the vegetables and season as desired.

Figure 11-1: Blanch vegetables in boiling water and then place them in an ice-cold water bath to stop the cooking.

Blanching times vary based on the vegetable and the size of the pieces, but check out Table 11-1 for approximate times for reference.

176 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Table 11-1 Approximate Blanching Times for Vegetables Vegetable Size Approximate Time Asparagus Spears 3 to 4 minutes Broccoli Florets, bite sized 3 minutes Brussels sprouts Whole 3 to 5 minutes Cabbage Leaves 5 to 10 minutes Carrots, baby Whole 5 minutes Carrots Diced or strips 2 minutes Cauliflower Florets, bite sized 3 minutes Corn Cob 4 minutes Eggplant Slices 3 minutes Green beans Whole 3 minutes Greens like spinach Leaves 2 minutes Mushrooms Whole or caps 5 minutes Okra Pod 3 to 5 minutes Peas, shel ed Whole 112 minutes Peas Pod 2 to 3 minutes Summer squash Bite-sized chunks 3 minutes Tomatoes Whole, for peeling 1 minute Zucchini Bite-sized chunks 3 minutes Give blanching a try with several of the recipes in this book, including the following recipe for Haricot Vert and the Yellow Tomato Sauce later in this chapter.

T Haricot Vert Haricot vert (pronounced ah-ree-co VEHR) is a fancy French word that literally means green beans and refers to (surprise!) green beans, or what we sometimes call string beans. If you find true French haricot vert in a gourmet market, use them in this recipe.

Theyre a bit smaller and thinner than common string beans, but the flavor is very similar. But if you cant find them, feel free to substitute fresh string beans. Canned beans wont work because theyre already cooked beyond tender. The Baricelli Inn in Cleveland (see Appendix A) contributed this classic and simple recipe. Enjoy this elegant vegetable with any hearty entre.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 177 Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes Yield: 6 servings 6 cups string beans 2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper Cut off the ends of the beans and blanch in boiling water for 1 minute (see the instructions earlier in this section); remove and place them in a cold water bath with ice. Drain and reheat in a skillet with the butter and salt and pepper to taste.

Tip: Serve these tasty veggies with Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle Mushrooms in Chapter 14, also from the Baricelli Inn.

Using Vegetables in Place of Pasta Pasta gets a lot of bad press these days, but the biggest problem with it is the portion size that most people typically eat. For healthy ways to include pasta and other grains in your diabetic diet, check out Chapter 10.

When youre craving the rich delicious Italian sauces but dont want the carbs of traditional pasta, veggies make a terrific substitute. Make noodles from strings of cucumber or slices of zucchini. Get started with this great Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams.

A mandoline is a handy tool to have around your kitchen. Take a look at it in Figure 11-2. Its a manual slicing device that quickly makes consistently sized cuts of foods. You can use it to julienne or make even 14 -inch strips of cucumber (as in the next recipe). You can make paper-thin strips of sweet potatoes for making your own baked chips or thick lemon wheels for water. Consider getting one to ease the prep work of making your own veggie noodles. Look for a mandoline at your local cooking supply store or gourmet shop.

178 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Figure 11-2: A mandoline makes quick work of slicing and creating julienne cuts.

T Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams David Burke, executive chef at DavidBurke and Donatella in New York City (see Appendix A), offers this shellfish lovers delight. After steeping in the delicious wine and clam sauce, the zucchini and cucumbers actually begin to taste much like linguine, without the calories and carbohydrate. Youre sure to impress your guests when you serve this light appetizer at your next dinner party. Because this dish is low in calories, theyll even have plenty of room left for the main course.

Clams are chock-full of vitamin B12 and iron. If youre cutting back on fat by avoiding red meat, you can feel confident that you wont be missing out on these essential nutrients, which are abundant in carnivorous diets. By the way, when purchasing clams and other shellfish, be sure the shells are closed. The open ones can be contaminated and cause severe food-borne illness.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Yield: 4 servings 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons chopped garlic Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 14 cup minced red peppers 1 large seedless cucumber, cut into long 18 to 24 Manila or littleneck clams julienne strips to resemble noodles (use a mandoline or a sharp knife) 112 cups white wine 1 large zucchini, julienned 2 lemons (juice and zest) 14 cup chopped parsley 1 Heat the olive oil in a saut pan. Add the garlic, shallots, and red peppers and saut until golden, approximately 10 minutes. Add the clams, white wine, and lemon juice.

Cover and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until the clams open, approximately 5 minutes.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 179 2 When the clams open, add the butter, salt and pepper to taste, and the red pepper flakes. Remove the clams. Toss in the cucumber and zucchini noodles and heat until they are warm and wilted, approximately 7 minutes.

3 Divide among 4 bowls and top each with the clams and the remaining juice. Garnish with the chopped parsley and lemon zest.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 183 Giving Veggies the Gourmet Treatment Vegetables are ripe for dressing up with the full gourmet treatment. Theyre flavorful on their own, but they take most seasonings, spices, and cooking techniques very well. You really cant mess them up unless you overcook them. Experiment with your favorite recipes by using the techniques in this chapter. Also, try a few that you havent tried before just to broaden your vegetable horizon.

T Pickled Vegetables Have your favorite veggies, but pickle them. Be creative! Try this with any vegetables you like. Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see Appendix A), serves these pickled vegetables as a side to many dishes. Its a tasty way to satisfy hunger pains without sending those blood sugars through the roof. You can see this dish in the color section.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 3 minutes Yield: 20 servings, or 3 pounds of pickles 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seed 3 sprigs thyme 1 teaspoon fennel seed 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 3 tablespoons salt 4 dried pepperoncini 3 pounds vegetables (such as carrots, 2 bay leaves cauliflower, cherry peppers, fennel, onions, or turnips), cleaned and cut into bite-sized 3 cups water pieces 1 cup white wine vinegar 1 Combine the mustard seed, fennel seed, peppercorns, pepperoncini, bay leaves, water, vinegar, thyme, sugar, and salt in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the vegetables and simmer for about 3 minutes.

2 Turn off the heat, but leave the vegetables in the pickling solution. The residual heat will cook them through.

3 Discard the pickling juice and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Tip: Serve these pickles with sandwiches or fried fish or just snack on them on their own.

184 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Zucchini is a terrific all-around vegetable. You can eat it raw, stew it, bake it in muffins, grill it, steam it, blanch it, or melt cheese on it. It makes excellent noodles (check out the Zucchini and Cucumber Linguine with Clams recipe earlier in this chapter). To get an idea of just how versatile this veggie is (and how much you can dress it up), check out the following recipe.

T Goat-Cheese-Stuffed Zucchini with Yellow Tomato Sauce Kyle Ketchum, from Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), has prepared this dish, which can make for a lovely appetizer, a side entree, or even a small meal. The distinct flavors of garlic, lemon, tomato, and savory goat cheese meld into one phenomenal flavor. They each stand strong alone, however, and are sure to come alive with every moment in your mouth. This vibrant dish is high in protein and quite low in carbohydrate, making it suitable for people managing their blood sugars. Keep in mind, however, that goat cheese is quite rich and high in saturated fat. Be sure to enjoy these zucchinis in moderation.

Try this yellow tomato sauce as indicated here or atop any favorite vegetable.

Preparation time: 40 minutes Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes Yield: 6 servings 6 medium green zucchini 14 cup basil chiffonade (see the tip at the end 1 pound chvre goat cheese (room of this recipe) temperature) Salt and pepper 14 cup bread crumbs 1 tablespoon olive oil Zest of 1 lemon 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Wash the zucchini and pat dry. Cut the ends off the zucchini and then cut each zucchini in half to create 2 pieces of equal length. Use a paring knife or melon baller to core out the center of the zucchini.

2 Put the goat cheese in a bowl and add the bread crumbs, lemon zest, and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and taste for seasoning. Spoon the cheese mixture into the zucchini shells.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 185 3 Drizzle the olive oil on the zucchini, season with salt and pepper to taste, and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheese begins to bubble and the bread crumbs start to brown, about 30 minutes.

4 Remove the zucchini from the oven, drizzle the Yellow Tomato Sauce (see the next recipe) on top of them, and return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes.

Tip: Chiffonade literally means made of rags, and it pretty well describes what the final product looks like. Leafy lettuce or herbs are rolled together tightly and then thinly sliced width-wise to form long, stringy strips.

Yellow Tomato Sauce 4 ripened yellow tomatoes (substitute red 2 tablespoons olive oil tomatoes if yellow ones arent available) Salt and pepper 14 cup minced garlic 1 Core the tomatoes, blanch in salted water for 10 seconds, and then shock in an ice water bath. Take a look at Figure 11-1, earlier in this chapter, to see how this technique works. Allow the tomatoes to chill for a few minutes and then remove from the water and peel the skin. Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out the pulp and seeds.

2 Place the tomatoes in a blender, add the garlic, and blend. With the blender on high, drizzle in the olive oil until the sauce achieves a smooth, even consistency, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Many of you may love Chinese food, but sometimes your favorite dishes are loaded with sweeteners and other starches that limit the frequency that you can enjoy them. The next time you get a craving for stir-fry, try out this flavorful dish, which doesnt have any added sugars.

186 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Asian Vegetable Stir-Fry With this stir-fry, be creative and use any vegetables that you like. The health benefits here dont get any better! All these vegetables in combination are rich in countless vitamin and minerals, notably vitamins A, C, B6, folate, calcium, and potassium. This stir-fry from Heather Dismore is prepared with minimal oil, so it remains quite low in total fat and calories. Its also rich in fiber, which makes it great for weight management, heart health, and especially blood sugar control. If you like, round out this dish with some tofu or chicken to get a bit of lean protein, and serve over a bed of brown rice for some more fiber, as well.

Preparation time: 40 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes Yield: 4 servings 2 ounces dehydrated wild mushrooms 2 cups baby bok choy, sliced in half 14 cup boiling water 1 red bell pepper, seeded and julienned 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 12 carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup broccoli florets 112 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot 1 cup snow peas, trimmed 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 Place the mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and cover them with the boiling water. Allow them to reconstitute for 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water. Chop them and reserve. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter to remove the grit. Combine the mushroom liquid, soy sauce, garlic, and gingerroot. Set aside.

2 Heat the oil in a wok or nonstick skillet. Stir-fry the mushrooms, bok choy, red pepper, carrots, and broccoli for 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture and snow peas. Reduce the heat and continue cooking until the veggies are crisp tender and the sauce thickens.

Moderation is the key when enjoying any fried foods. Many diabetics are encouraged to stay away from fried food entirely. In general, its good advice because so many foods are heavily battered with starchy concoctions that no one needs to eat. But on occasion, you can enjoy fried foods that are lightly dredged, or lightly coated, in flour, as in the Vegetable Fritto Misto.

Chapter 11: Adding Veggies to Your Meals 187 T Vegetable Fritto Misto This dish from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), calls for significant amounts of milk and white flour, but not to worry. Because theyre used only to coat the vegetables, neither provides a significant amount of calories or carbohydrates.

The flour and milk help create a thick, crispy coating on the veggies when theyre sauted. Though canola oil is a wonderful source of monounsaturated, heart-healthy fat, its still very dense in calories, so be thrifty here! When the veggies are finished, drain them well on paper towels to get rid of some of the excess oil. You may also want to pair these veggies with a light entre, such as fish or chicken, both low-calorie, lean sources of protein.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 35 minutes Yield: 4 servings 4 tablespoons canola oil 2 cups lowfat milk 12 cup artichoke hearts 2 cups flour 12 head cauliflower, chopped into florets Salt and pepper 10 pitted green olives Lemon wedges (optional) 1 large portobello mushroom, large dice 1 Heat the oil in a deep skillet until it starts smoking. While youre waiting for the oil to heat, place the artichoke hearts, cauliflower, olives, and mushrooms in the milk in a shallow bowl and soak. Place the soaked veggies in a resealable plastic bag with the flour. Shake to coat the veggies with flour. Put the floured vegetables into a strainer and shake off the excess flour.

2 Carefully place the vegetables in batches into the hot oil. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown.

3 Remove the vegetables from the oil onto paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place them in a bowl and serve with a wedge or two of lemon, if desired.

Tip: To ensure that your food absorbs the least amount of oil possible, make sure the oil is very hot before you begin frying it. This step ensures that your food gets a quick, crispy outer coating without getting saturated in oil.

Preparation time: minutes Cooking time: minutes Yield: 6 servings 1 package dry active yeast 2 tablespoons olive oil 12 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees) 1 pound fresh asparagus 1 to 2 cups white flour Cornmeal as needed 1 cup whole wheat flour 1 cup fontina, or Monterey Jack cheese, grated 3 tablespoons rye flour 14 cup good quality Parmesan, grated 1 teaspoon salt, divided 12 tablespoon white truffle oil 23 cup warm water 1 To make the dough, dissolve the yeast in the 12 cup water in a small warmed bowl. Stir in 12 cup white flour, cover, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes until bubbles form on the surface.

2 Meanwhile, in a larger bowl, mix 12 cup of white flour, whole-wheat flour, and rye flour, and 112 teaspoons salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and the remaining warm water and olive oil. Mix well and knead until the dough is smooth, adding more flour if necessary. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn over in order to coat the top of the dough. Cover and put in a warm place for at least 112 hours.

3 Bring a medium size pan of water to a boil over high heat, and cut the asparagus into 14 inch slices, discarding the tough stems. Blanch and shock the asparagus. For details on how to blanch and shock vegetables, take a look at the section, Blanching vegetables for optimum taste and nutrition, earlier in this chapter. Set the asparagus aside until ready to use.

4 Place a large baking stone on the bottom shelf of an oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees 30 minutes before baking.

5 Punch down the dough and place on a lightly floured wooden board or counter. Cut into 6 equal pieces. Cover the dough you are not working with a bowl or a dry towel. With your hands, shape one of the pieces of dough into a round disc. Then roll it flatter with a rolling pin. Place this on a pizza peel (a large paddle with a long handle used to transfer a raw pizza to the oven) covered with 1 tablespoon cornmeal, and stretch into a thin round with your fingers. Make sure the pizza dough can slide, and isnt stuck to the pizza peel. Cover the dough with the fontina cheese, then the asparagus, then the Parmesan. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough.

6 Place pizza in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until it is lightly browned on the bottom. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the truffle oil and serve.

Tip: The pizza dough will remain usable at least all day if kept cool, and more if refriger-ated after the first rising. If you do refrigerate the dough, allow at least one hour for it to come to room temperature.

T Asparagus Bread Pudding Layered with Fontina Bread pudding may not seem to be a diabetic friendly meal, but this recipe from Tante Maries Cooking School in San Francisco is made with whole-grain bread and loaded with tasty asparagus.

Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 60 minutes Yield: 4 servings Non-stick cooking spray 2 eggs 2 tablespoons freshly grated 6 to 8 thick slices whole- 1 teaspoon salt Parmesan cheese grain bread, dry 2 teaspoons freshly ground 12 cup Fontina cheese, Swiss 1 1 cheese or other white 2 to 2 cups nonfat milk black pepper cheese, shredded 2 pounds asparagus 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 2-quart souffl dish with non-stick cooking spray; set aside.

2 Place the bread in a single layer in a shallow dish. Pour 1 12 cups milk over the bread.

Let the bread soak until the bread has absorbed the milk and becomes soft, about 30 minutes. Press the bread slices to extract the milk. Measure the milk; you should be able to squeeze 12 cup milk from the bread. If not, make up the difference with the additional 12 cup milk as needed. Set the milk and bread aside.

3 Meanwhile, trim the asparagus, removing the woody ends. Cut the remaining stalks on the diagonal into thin slivers each about 2 inches long and 38 of an inch thick. Blanch slivered asparagus until barely tender. Shock the blanched asparagus immediately. Drain and set aside.

4 In a bowl, beat together the eggs, salt, pepper, and the 12 cup milk from the bread soaking until well blended. Layer 13 of the bread in the prepared dish. Set 6 or 8 asparagus slivers aside and top the bread layer with half of the remaining asparagus. Spread 13 of each of the cheeses over the asparagus.

5 Repeat the layers, using half of the remaining bread, all of the remaining asparagus, and half of the remaining cheese. Arrange the remaining bread on top, spread the remaining cheese over it, and garnish with the reserved asparagus slivers. Pour the milk-egg mixture over the layers.

6 Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the middle of the pudding comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

192 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Baby Artichokes, Gigante Beans, and Summer Vegetable Cartoccio with Creamy Polenta Cartoccio, or baking the vegetables in packets of parchment or foil, captures all the aromatics of the herbs and makes for an elegant presentation. Millennium in San Francisco shows you how easy it is to create this elegant meal at home.

Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 6 servings 1 quart of water 3 ripe Roma or other tomato, quartered 1 head of garlic, cloves peeled or 18 medium 2 summer squash, diced to large garlic cloves Other vegetables of choice Juice from 12 lemon 12 bunch basil, leaves picked 6 baby to mid-size artichokes 6 small sprigs of rosemary 6 pieces of bakers parchment or foil cut into 1 lemon sliced into 6 slices 8-10 inch squares 1 tablespoon capers 112 cup of cooked gigante beans, or canellini beans Salt, pepper, and chile flakes to taste 12 oyster mushrooms 1 cup vegetable stock or white wine 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

2 Blanch the garlic cloves in 1 quart of water for 1 minute; then drain and set aside. Add the lemon juice to the boiling water. Clean the artichokes, and cut them in half. Blanch until the heart of the artichoke is just soft. Drain and reserve.

3 Place 1 piece of parchment (or foil if using) on a flat surface. Place 2 artichoke halves in the center, followed by 3 cloves of garlic, 14 cup of the beans, 2 oyster mushrooms, 2 pieces of tomato, some of the summer squash, plus any other vegetable you are using.

Top with basil leaves, rosemary sprig, a slice of lemon, a few capers, salt, pepper, and chile flakes if using. Pour 2 tablespoons of the stock or wine over the ingredients. Fold the parchment over the filling, and crimp the edges until sealed. Place sealed packet on a baking pan. Repeat with remaining parchment and ingredients.

4 Bake for 15 minutes. Place the baked cartoccio in a large shallow bowl with a portion of the Creamy Polenta (see the next recipe) and present to your guests.

Identifying Good Reasons to Serve Seafood Like meat and poultry, seafood supplies high-quality protein, balancing the fats and carbohydrates in the meal and providing calories that have little effect on blood glucose. But the benefits of eating fish extend beyond this:  The oceans are a rich reservoir of minerals, and all creatures that live in the sea are in part made of these minerals. When you eat fish, you are likely also to be consuming iodine, selenium, phosphorus, potassium, iron, and calcium.

196 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great  Eating seafood regularly may help improve kidney function in patients with severe diabetes.

Seafood is a good source of B vitamins, especially niacin, and also contains fat-soluble vitamin A. In addition, fatty fish are one of the few food sources of vitamin D.

The most important nutrient in fish may well be the omega-3 fatty acids.

These polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially high in the fat and oils of fish that live in cold water. (Because these oils stay liquid at room temperature, they may help insulate the fish against the cold.) The omega-3 fatty acids appear to lower the undesirable form of cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and to raise the desirable form, HDL cholesterol. These fats also have an anti-inflammatory effect. The fish with the highest percentage of these healthy oils are salmon, sardines, tuna, and mackerel.

Healthy Americans are encouraged to eat two seafood servings per week on a regular basis.

Preparing Fish in Healthy Ways You dont need to deep-fry your catch of the day or order deep-fried fish when you eat out in order to get fish that tastes good. Not only is this type of fish loaded with fat, but the type of fat is usually unhealthy. When fats heat to high temperatures, such as in deep-frying, toxic by-products are formed. It is far better to eat seafood prepared by methods such as baking, pan roasting, or grilling  all delicious and healthy ways of cooking fish. The following sections cover a variety of methods you can use to cook fish the healthy way.

Baking your way to fish bliss Baking is one of the first techniques most people learn when theyre learning to cook. In fact, many people dont learn to bake; they simply seem to know how to bake. Technically speaking, baking means to cook something by surrounding it with dry heat. In most cases, you bake in an oven, a closed environment where you control the temperature.

Baking doesnt mean boring. Try out this flavorful baked cod to see how baking can be both easy and delicious.

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 197 Horseradish-Crusted Cod with Lentils This recipe, from Derek Dickerson, owner of Dereks Bistro in Pasadena, California (see Appendix A), shows that you can develop a great-tasting meal for a person with diabetes. The cod is a lean source of protein and prepared simply by baking, a great lowfat cooking technique. The fillets are topped with a touch of horseradish, which lends a ton of flavor but very little added fat and calories. The lentils are full of fiber and complex carbohydrate, making them a perfect choice. They are combined with crme frache, a heavy cream with a nutty flavor. This ingredient is included in such a modest amount, however, that it contributes very little fat and calories. The lentils, however, are left creamy and decadent.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings 1 pound Puy lentils (or substitute the lentils of 4 teaspoons horseradish sauce your choice) 4 cod fillets, 6 ounces each 2 sprigs fresh parsley 4 tablespoons panko bread crumbs (substitute 4 tablespoons crme frache (or substitute 3 crushed cornflakes if you cant find these tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon Japanese bread crumbs in the Asian section sour cream) of your market) 14 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon olive oil Salt and pepper 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the lentils in a large saucepan with enough cold water to cover them, plus an extra couple of inches. Add the whole sprigs of the parsley and bring to a boil. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until tender. Discard the parsley sprigs.

Drain the lentils and toss with the crme frache and chopped parsley. Season to taste.

Set aside and keep warm.

2 Spread the horseradish sauce over each fish fillet and then press in the bread crumbs to coat. Grease a nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil. Place the fish fillets on the baking sheet and bake for 14 to 17 minutes, until the fish is just cooked and the bread crumbs are golden.

3 Place one-fourth of the lentils on each of four plates. Top each with one piece of baked fish.

198 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Poaching to perfection Poaching is a method of cooking that gently cooks the food in a small amount of liquid, just below the boiling point. In the case of seafood, this liquid is often highly flavored with herbs, wine, stock, and other seasonings. Give poaching a shot with this terrific salmon recipe.

Poached King Salmon with Steamed Asparagus and Tapenade Salsa This recipe comes to your kitchen from that of Chef Didier Labbe of the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). The salmon is poached, which is the lightest method of cooking, requiring only water. Adding wine and other herbs to the cooking liquid, however, is a great way to infuse good flavor into poached poultry or fish, as this recipe calls for. This dish is a wonderful source of omega-3 fatty acids as well as other beneficial heart-healthy fats.

Combined with asparagus, the vitamin A content of this dish is off the chart, so eat up for eye health! Asparagus also lends a significant source of fiber, some good protein, and a bunch of folate. For women of childbearing age, folate is essential for the prevention of birth defects and has even healthier outcomes in diabetic patients as well. For everyone else, adequate folate intakes can also lower something called homocysteine, high levels of which are linked to heart disease.

By the way, if you dont have the time or energy to prepare your own fish stock, you can find the prepared version at many grocery stores and specialty food stores. Just remember, homemade always tastes better and is better for you, too!

Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings Fish Stock (see the following recipe) 4 salmon fillets, 6 ounces each 12 pound green asparagus Tapenade Salsa (see the accompanying 1 recipe) 2 pound white asparagus (if not available, use an additional 12 pound green asparagus) 1 Prepare the fish stock.

2 While the stock is cooking, prepare the asparagus. Add the asparagus to lightly salted, boiling water and cook until tender. Immediately remove the asparagus from the boiling water and shock it in a cold-water bath. (Check out Chapter 11 for tips on blanching and shocking vegetables.) 3 Bring prepared fish stock to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add the salmon fillets to the simmering fish stock and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from broth and keep warm.

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 199 4 Prepare the tapenade salsa (see the accompanying recipe).

5 Just before serving, reheat the asparagus in the simmering fish stock, approximately 5 minutes.

6 Serve each salmon fillet with the asparagus tips and top with the Tapenade Salsa.

Fish Stock 1 pound fish bones 1 pinch ground cloves 2 cups water, divided 14 cup dry white wine 1 small onion, diced Juice of 1 lemon 12 pound leeks, sliced and well rinsed 1 In a large saut pan, add the fish bones to 1 cup of cold water and bring to a simmer.

2 Add the onion, leeks, clove, and white wine and return to a simmer; then add the remaining 1 cup water and the lemon juice. Continue to cook the bones for an additional 30 minutes.

3 Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer. Reserve the broth; discard the bones and other solids.

Tip: You can purchase fish bones at fish markets or at specialty food stores that sell fresh fish. Alternatively, you can find a fish stock base, like Redi-Base, on the Web at www.

redibase.com/about.htm#redibase . Its a concentrate version of stock.

Tapenade Salsa 2 ounces anchovies 1 cup olive oil 1 cup pitted black olives 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 2 cloves garlic 1 In a food processor, combine the anchovies, olives, and garlic until the mixture becomes a paste, about 45 seconds.

2 In a separate bowl, combine the olive oil and vinegar.

3 Combine the two mixtures and stir.

Pan roasting seafood sensations In the strictest culinary terms, pan roasting is a two-step process that first sears and seals a thicker piece of meat or chicken in a pan on the stovetop and then finishes that piece in the oven, in the same pan you started in. So when were talking about seafood, the term pan roasting is probably not 200 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great exactly accurate. Because seafood cooks so fast, theres usually not a need to finish it in the oven. But you can make a terrific sauce in the same pan you seared your fish in.

Whatever you call it, pan-roasted food is downright good, as these next three recipes prove. Use a quality saut pan that heats evenly. And make sure to heat it up well before you place your fish in to ensure an even, quick crust.

Tilapia Franchaise If youre new to the world of seafood, tilapia is a good place to start. Its a mild-flavored white fish that really takes on the flavors of the food its cooked with. This dish is simple to make, but very impressive for guests, because you cook the whole thing in a single pan. Sear the fish and then create the rich sauce  all without changing pans or washing a single dish. What could be simpler?

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 2 servings Nonstick cooking spray 12 cup whole-wheat flour 2 pieces (6 ounces each) tilapia (or other flat 14 cup white cooking wine white fish) 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 egg 12 cup low-salt chicken broth 1 Coat a medium skillet with the cooking spray and place over medium heat.

2 Rinse and dry the tilapia. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg. Place the flour in a flat plate. Lightly coat both sides of the fish with the flour, coat the fish with the egg, and place directly in the hot skillet.

3 When the fish is golden brown on the first side (approximately 4 minutes), flip it over to brown the other side.

4 When the fish is golden brown (roughly after 2 to 3 minutes), reduce the heat to low.

Add the wine and let it reduce to half the amount. Add the lemon juice and broth and let the liquid reduce as it cooks the fish.

5 When the liquid has reduced to approximately one quarter and appears to have slightly thickened, remove from the heat and serve.

Tip: Serve with fresh vegetables, salad, whole-wheat couscous, or brown rice for some extra fiber.

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 201 Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillet with Lemon-Dill Butter Sauce Lewis Rossman, from Cetrella in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), offers an excellent pan-roasted recipe. The sauce is fantastic, the butter adds the right creaminess, the lemon juice provides the perfect acidity, and the pungent dill ties them together. Look for baby leeks because theyre more tender and subtle flavored for a great addition to the salad. And be sure to check out the instructions for the right way to wash and slice leeks in Chapter 8.

Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 2 servings 12 cucumber 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1 bunch arugula 2 salmon fillets (6 ounces each), 1 inch thick 6 baby leeks, trimmed, cleaned, and blanched 1 tablespoon Meyer lemon juice (or substitute 1 large leek, sliced; check out 3 tablespoons butter Chapter 8 for details on cleaning and slicing leeks) 3 sprigs dill, chopped Salt and pepper 1 Prepare the cucumber salad first. Chop the cucumber into half moons and place in a bowl with the arugula and the baby leeks. Season with salt and pepper to taste and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.

2 To cook the fish, heat a saut pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the fish with salt and pepper and, when the pan is hot, add the fillets. Cook for 312 minutes on each side (medium-rare to medium). Place the salad in the center of the plate and put the fish on top.

3 To make the sauce, wipe clean the same saut pan and add the lemon juice. Allow the juice to reduce by half and add the butter. Swirl the butter vigorously into the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste and the chopped dill. Pour over the fish.

A fumet (pronounced foo-MAY) is a heavily concentrated stock. In the case of the next recipe, its a stock made from shrimp shells. You can make a fumet by boiling fish heads, bones, shellfish shells, or whole fish with wine, aromatic herbs, and vegetables and then reducing it to concentrate the flavor.

202 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Use a fumet to season sauces and soups or to braise or poach fish or vegetables. Its subtle flavor imparts the delicate essence of seafood with a slight acidity (thanks to the wine), but it doesnt overpower the main event.

If youd rather not make your own fumet, look for fish stock or fish stock glace or base (an even more concentrated product that must be reconstituted with water before using) at your local fish or gourmet market.

Pan-Roasted Cod with Shrimp and Mirliton Squash Here is a wonderful contribution from Chef Kevin Rathbun, of Rathbuns in Atlanta, Georgia (see Appendix A). If youre keeping in mind blood sugar control and heart health, fish is always a great choice  and this recipe makes use of two. The cod and shrimp come together well with the squash ragout.

Mirliton squash, also known as chayote squash, is similar to other squash varieties, and it makes for a wonderful addition to soups, stews, and casseroles. Look for a small, avocado-sized squash with a firm pale green skin. It has a white mild-flavored flesh that takes on the subtle flavors of the shrimp fumet very well. Its peak season runs from December to March, so if you cant find it, zucchini works well too. This dish is rich in lean protein, low in carbs and saturated fat, and full of vitamins A and C.

Preparation time: 1 hour Cooking time: 40 minutes Yield: 4 servings Fumet: 1 cup peeled, cubed tomato Shrimp shells, from twenty 26/30 shrimp (from 12 cup Shrimp Fumet shrimp in ragout or purchased at a local fish 2 tablespoons butter market; see the note at the end of the recipe) 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 shallot, chopped 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 bay leaf 2 tablespoons parsley (whole leaves) 1 thyme sprig Cod: 12 cup Chardonnay 4 cod fillets (6 ounces each) Ragout: Salt and pepper 20 white shrimp, 26/30s, peeled and deveined 2 teaspoons flour 2 cups 14-inch cubes of peeled chayote squash (also called mirliton), blanched (see Chapter 2 tablespoons olive oil 11 for blanching instructions) Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 203 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the shrimp shells, shallot, bay leaf, thyme, char-donnay, and enough water to cover the ingredients in a small saucepot. Slowly bring to a boil and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to extract some flavor from the shells. After the flavor has been extracted, strain the liquid. Discard the shells and other solids and reserve the liquid.

2 Make the ragout: In a medium saucepan, place the shrimp, squash, tomato, fumet, butter, lemon juice, salt, and parsley. Simmer until the shrimp is done, approximately 5 to 7 minutes, and hold until ready to serve. Adjust seasoning as needed.

3 Lightly season the cod fillets with salt and pepper to taste and dust one side with flour.

4 Heat the olive oil in a saut pan and place the cod fillets flour side down in the oil. Saut to a golden brown, approximately 4 minutes, and then turn and transfer to the oven for 4 to 6 minutes.

5 When the cod is finished baking in the oven, place each fillet in a bowl and pour the ragout on top.

Note: Shrimp fall into various size categories, and 26/30 means you get 26 to 30 shrimp in each pound. For more information, see Chapter 7.

Getting your grill on Grilling is similar to broiling, but the heat comes from a different direction.

In grilling, the heat source is under the food. In broiling, the heat source is above the food.

Tuna is an excellent fish for grilling. Its meat is firm, not flaky like white fish.

It stands up nicely to spices and flavorings. And because its usually served extremely rare, it takes very little time to cook. Try grilled tuna in the following recipe.

In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding the methyl mercury content of some fish. Water pollution may increase the level of this metal to toxic amounts in certain areas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautions pregnant and nursing women, as well as women of childbearing age, to limit consumption of swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tile fish to less than 7 ounces per week. These fish are shown to have the greatest mercury levels compared with other fish species. Ahi tuna is generally considered to be safe. However, if youre concerned about the mercury content of fish, visit the FDA Web site, www.fda.gov, to find out more.

204 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Grilled Ahi Tuna with Asian Slaw If youre in the mood for something thats light yet delicious and satisfying, this dish from food writer Heather Dismore is perfect. Its full of protein yet low in total calories and fat. The slaw provides a good source of vegetables, and the dressing helps to round out the dish with few added calories.

Fresh tuna is best when prepared very rare in the middle  nearly raw. For this reason, be sure to purchase sushi-grade tuna at the fish market. Its safer, less likely to be contaminated, and therefore less likely to cause foodborne illness. Pregnant and nursing women should always avoid all raw fish, including rare tuna. Otherwise, be sure to meet the American Heart Associations recommendation to consume 2 servings of fish per week.

Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours for marinating Cooking time: 6 to 10 minutes Yield: 4 servings 4 ahi tuna steaks, about 2 pounds (be sure 1 teaspoon honey theyre sushi grade) 1 teaspoon light soy sauce Marinade: 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro 14 cup light soy sauce 1 teaspoon finely grated gingerroot 14 cup mirin (sweet rice wine) 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil Slaw: 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 small head napa cabbage, shredded 2 tablespoons minced fresh gingerroot 12 cup shredded carrot 212 tablespoons minced green onions 14 cup chopped green onion 3 tablespoons minced garlic 14 cup julienned red pepper Dressing: 14 cup julienned yellow pepper 23 cup rice wine vinegar 12 cup julienned daikon radish 12 tablespoon Splenda (or to taste) Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 205 1 Make the marinade by combining the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger, green onions, and garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Place the ahi steaks in the bag.

Gently coat the steaks in the marinade. Place in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning occasionally.

2 About a half hour before the ahi has finished marinating, prepare the slaw: First mix the dressing ingredients (vinegar, Splenda, honey, soy sauce, cilantro, gingerroot, and sesame seeds) in a large bowl. In another large bowl, mix the slaw ingredients (cabbage, carrots, onion, red and yellow peppers, and radish). Toss the cabbage mixture with most of the dressing. Reserve a small amount of dressing for later.

3 Let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature. If youd prefer to refrigerate the slaw, extend standing time to 1 hour (and start preparing it about 40 minutes after you start marinating the tuna). Preheat the grill.

4 Grill the ahi tuna 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Broil about 5 inches from the heating element, if you prefer.) The outside should be gray brown; however, the inside will remain red. Be sure not to overcook the steaks, as they will quickly dry out and lose flavor.

5 Slice the tuna thinly and serve with the slaw. Drizzle the reserved dressing on top.

206 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great B.B.Q. Cedar-Planked Salmon Chef Vitaly Paley of Paleys Place in Portland, Oregon (see Appendix A), has created a sumptuous feast of salmon with this cedar barbecue. You can prepare it in the oven or on an outdoor grill. As the planks roast on the fire, the salmon retains the aromas and begins to employ the earthy cedar flavor of the wooden planks. Note: You can find cedar planks at a lumber store  specifically look for untreated cedar shingles  or in kitchen supply stores or gourmet shops that sell lots of knickknacks.

Wild salmon is preferred  it contains more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and far less saturated fat than its farmed counterpart. Salmon is a gift of nature and a gift to your health as well. Enjoy this fatty fish and reap its medicinal benefits.

Special tool: 1 cedar plank, 1 to 2 inches larger than salmon fillet all the way around, soaked in water for at least 2 hours Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus optional marinating time of 1 to 2 hours Cooking time: 20 minutes Yield: 6 servings 12 tablespoon salt 5 tablespoons olive oil, divided 12 cup brown sugar 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped Zest from 1 orange 12 cup chiffonade basil (roll the basil together 1 salmon fillet (2 pounds), pin bone removed tightly and then thinly slice width-wise to form (ask the person at the seafood counter to do long, stringy strips) this step for you) 1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced 1 Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

2 Mix up the dry marinade. In a small bowl mix the salt, brown sugar, and orange zest and spread it generously on both sides of the salmon fillet. (You can marinate the fish 1 to 2 hours in advance, if you prefer. Refrigerate the fish while its marinating if you marinate it in advance.) Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 207 3 Brush one side of the cedar plank with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and place it in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

4 Spread the garlic on the olive-oil-coated side of the plank and then place the salmon fillet on top. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with the basil. Cover the fish generously with the sliced onions and then drizzle it with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.

5 Place the planked fish in the preheated oven. Cook the salmon for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 degrees. The cooking time will vary with the thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

If you prefer to cook the salmon on a grill, follow these instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Place the oiled plank directly on the grill. Let the plank smoke a bit before adding the fish. If the plank catches on fire, spritz it with water. Close the grill and cook the salmon for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is medium-rare and a probe thermometer reads 120 degrees. The cooking time will vary with the thickness of your fish. Allow approximately 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

Broiling your seafood bounty You may find that many recipes call for broiling. Basically, you broil food by cooking it using a heat source from above, usually called (you guessed it) a broiler. Typically, food is heated for relatively short periods of time at a high heat, which usually creates a crispy coating. In most cases, broiling is a lowfat cooking technique requiring little additional fat and allowing the natural fats present in the food to drip away. All in all, a pretty healthy combination!

208 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Broiled Salmon with Herb Sauce and Cucumbers As if there werent already a bunch of reasons to include salmon in your diet, heres one more. Salmon is a wonderful source of selenium, which happens to be another disease-fighting antioxidant. Add that to the long list of this seafoods many health benefits!

This salmon recipe, coming to us from Barbetta Restaurant in New York (see Appendix A), is broiled and paired with a sauce flavored with a variety of herbs. Although most creamy sauces are usually quite high in fat and calories, this one remains extremely light. The recipe takes advantage of lowfat yogurt instead of its full-fat counterpart. You can make simple substitutions like this with most dairy products, thus sacrificing a lot of fat and calories with barely noticeable change in taste.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes Yield: 4 servings 14 cup finely chopped fresh chives Juice of 1 lemon 212 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 1 medium cucumber, unpeeled, thinly sliced 1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley, divided 4 fresh salmon fillets; 6 ounces each 12 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro Salt and pepper 10 ounces plain lowfat yogurt 1 Place an oven-safe grill pan (or broiler pan) in the oven. Preheat the broiler (on low setting if possible).

2 Place the chives in a blender with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Blend for approximately 1 minute, until well combined. Place the chives mixture in a small bowl. Add half of the chopped parsley and all of the cilantro, the yogurt, and lemon juice. Set aside.

3 Mix the cucumber slices with remaining chopped parsley.

4 Prepare 4 dinner plates by spreading the herb sauce in each one. Arrange the cucumber slices over the sauce. Put aside.

5 Brush the salmon fillets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 209 6 Remove the grill pan from the oven. Brush it with the remaining olive oil. Place the salmon fillets in the heated, oiled pan.

7 Place the grill pan under the broiler, about 5 inches from the heating element.

8 Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the top of the salmon acquires a golden to light brown color. Flip the fish to the other side. Allow the fillets to remain in the oven an additional 2 to 3 minutes.

9 Place one salmon fillet in the center of each dinner plate, over the cucumber slices and sauce.

Surveying Superior Shellfish The term shellfish includes seafood such as shrimp, lobster, oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops, which all have a shell instead of fins and gills. It also includes some seafood that have a not-so-obvious shell, like octopus and squid.

Shellfish are sold by their size and weight. For tips on how to pick the right shellfish for your recipe, check out Chapter 7.

The texture of these tasty tidbits ranges from exceptionally tender, in the case of lobster and some shrimp, to a bit chewy, in the case of octopus.

Its probably not a surprise that the tenderness of these delicate creatures depends, in part, on how well you cook them.

Avoid overcooking shellfish. Doing so causes the texture to become rubbery and unpleasant.

210 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Rock Shrimp Ceviche With this ceviche (pronounced se-VEECH or se-vee-CHEE) dish from Lewis Rossman at Cetrella Bistro and Caf in Half Moon Bay, California (see Appendix A), you and your company are in for a treat. Its even simple to prepare. Rock shrimp is a sweet shrimp with an almost lobsterlike flavor and texture. Its an extremely succulent shrimp that cooks quickly, so its a natural choice for this no-heat cooking method. Born out of the necessity of using acid to retard food spoilage, ceviche is prepared through a delicious and healthy cooking technique. In a nutshell, raw seafood, usually whitefish or shrimp, is placed in an acid, most often lime juice, which in essence cooks the fish. Leave it to marinate for an hour, and its ready to serve. Ceviche makes for a great first course, especially in the hot summer months, as it is quite light and refreshing and contains almost no fat. Enjoy!

Preparation time: 10 minutes, plus marinating time of 1 hour Yield: 4 servings 1 pound rock shrimp, roughly chopped 12 cup fresh lime juice (about 4 limes) 1 mango, small dice 1 pinch chili flakes 1 shallot, finely chopped Salt and pepper 12 cup chopped fresh cilantro Place the rock shrimp in a bowl and mix together with the mango, shallot, cilantro, lime juice, and chili flakes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. The ceviche looks particularly attractive served in a martini glass.

Note: Use only very fresh (or freshly frozen and then very recently thawed) seafood in ceviche because it never reaches temperatures high enough to kill strong bacteria.

Seared Diver Scallops with Bacon and Shallot Reduction If youre looking to show off some cooking skills, this scallop dish from Chef Kyle Ketchum at Lark in Detroit, Michigan (see Appendix A), is sure to impress. Just a small amount of bacon as a condiment helps to achieve some big flavor  even without Chapter 12: Boning Up on Fish Cookery 211 breaking the days saturated fat and cholesterol limit. Scallops are great sources of protein while remaining low in total and saturated fat, so theyre a healthier alternative to red meats. Serve this dish atop a bed of whole-wheat couscous to complete the meal.

Diver scallops are sea scallops that are harvested by, well, divers. They can be a bit more expensive than standard sea scallops since theyre harvested by people rather than by boats dragging chains along the ocean floor, but typically theyre less gritty and have a better texture. Plus, theyre more environmentally friendly because divers generally take only the larger mature scallops, leaving the smaller younger scallops to grow for future scallop eaters.

U10 refers to the size of the scallops used in this recipe and means that one pound of these scallops contains less than 10 (or Under 10) scallops per pound.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 2 servings 4 slices slab bacon, cut into 12-inch strips 6 U10 diver scallops (you can substitute 1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced 1 pound of sea scallops) 1 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cup low-sodium chicken stock 2 tablespoons butter 12 asparagus stalks (approximately 14 pound), cleaned, trimmed, and blanched (see Chap- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives ter 11 for blanching instructions) Salt and pepper 14 cup Balsamic Syrup (see the following recipe) 1 Add the bacon to a small saut pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the shallots and continue cooking for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and butter and bring to a simmer until the stock has reduced by half and the onions are tender, approximately 20 minutes. Add the chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.

2 Preheat a medium saut pan over high heat. Season the scallops evenly on both sides with salt and pepper. Add the oil to the hot pan and saut the scallops approximately 2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops from the pan and place 3 scallops in the center of each plate. Reheat the asparagus in the skillet you used to cook the scallops. Put the bacon and shallot reduction (from Step 1) around the scallops. Arrange the asparagus around the scallops. Drizzle the Balsamic Syrup over the scallops and asparagus.

Hopefully, if youve read any of this book Portobello Sauce at this point, you realize this assumption couldnt be farther from reality.

In this chapter, we show you how to safely use poultry in your diet. We give you tips to keep the most popular piece of chicken  the breast  tasty, moist, and downright exciting. And finally, we give you some great ways to include turkey in your regimen.

Including Poultry in Your Diet Nutritionists define a portion as 3.5 ounces. What this serving size looks like on your dinner plate, with chicken for instance, is typically either a half chicken breast or a chicken drumstick and thigh. To reduce the fat content, eat the meat but dont eat the skin.

Maintaining good sanitary practices in your kitchen is important when youre working with poultry, no matter how much poultry youre cooking. Keep the following hints in mind to minimize bacterial contamination from poultry: 214 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great  Rinse any poultry pieces and pat them dry before using them. This step helps remove bacteria that are often present in poultry.

Dont place raw poultry near, over, or in any foods that wont be cooked before theyre eaten. Proper cooking kills most bacteria found in poultry, but never let the liquid in raw poultry drip onto salads, sauces, condiments, and the like.

Keep a separate color cutting board only used for raw poultry. You can significantly reduce the chances that you cut lettuce on the same board you sliced chicken on if theyre different colors.

Clean your knife after cutting raw poultry. Wash it thoroughly in hot, soapy water.

Thoroughly sanitize any surfaces that come into contact with any raw poultry or its juices. Use an antibacterial cleaner thats specifically made for this purpose.

Always cook poultry to the appropriate food-safe temperature, as listed in Table 13-1.

Table 13-1 Safe Cooking Temperatures for Poultry Product Temperature Ground turkey, chicken 165 Poultry breasts 170 Chicken, whole 180 Duck and goose 180 Poultry thighs, wings 180 Turkey, whole 180 Making the Best of Chicken Breasts The breast is the leanest of all the chickens parts, with the lowest total and saturated fat content, thus making it the healthiest choice for your heart.

Chicken Breasts with Lemon and Garlic This dish, by Christopher Lee from the Eccolo restaurant in Berkeley, California (see Appendix A), takes full advantage of a chicken breasts white, lean meat. Just remember to remove the skin after the chicken has cooked.

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 215 Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes Yield: 6 servings 6 chicken breasts, 6 ounces each, bone in, Juice of 2 lemons, divided with skin 1 cup dry white wine Salt 3 cups chicken stock or water 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided A few thyme sprigs 30 garlic cloves Zest of 1 lemon, divided 4 tablespoons butter 1 A few hours before cooking, season the chicken breasts with salt. Refrigerate the chicken and bring to room temperature when ready to use.

2 In a small saut pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and add the garlic. Cook it over medium-low heat, allowing it to brown but not burn. Shake the pan occasionally or stir the garlic with a spoon to keep it from burning. Add a little water if the garlic starts to brown too much. Cook the garlic until it is soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.

3 Once the garlic is soft, in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, heat the remaining olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and slowly brown the chicken, skin side down, until the skin is golden and crisp. Turn the breasts over and reduce the heat to medium-low.

4 Once you flip the breasts, add the garlic and olive oil sauce to the chicken pan. Add half the lemon juice, the white wine, the chicken stock, the thyme, and half the lemon zest.

Bring the sauce to a simmer and cover. Continue cooking for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, or until the breasts are cooked through and tender, but not dried out. Check the chicken and sauce occasionally, stirring as needed. If the pan begins to dry, add a little water to maintain about a half inch of liquid in the pan.

5 When the chicken is cooked and its juices run clear, remove it from the pan to a warm serving platter. Keep warm. Increase the heat in the skillet until the sauce begins to boil, and then shut off the heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Adjust the seasonings with salt, pepper, and the remaining lemon juice, if desired. Pour the sauce over the chicken.

6 Garnish with the remaining lemon zest. Remove the chicken skin before eating.

216 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Chicken Scampi When we say you can enjoy good food that is good for you, this dish is an example of exactly what we mean. Food writer Heather Dismore created this dish thats delicious and lowfat. The total fat and saturated fat content are low simply because youre using skinless chicken breast  the leanest part of the chicken. The recipe calls for some butter, but just enough to enrich the flavor without significantly raising the fat content.

The chicken is full of wonderful flavor from fresh herbs, lemon juice, wine, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. The longer you can marinate the chicken, the more flavor it will have when done.

Preparation time: 6 to 7 hours (mostly marinating time) Cooking time: 20 to 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings 14 teaspoon pepper 5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, 4 2 cloves garlic, minced, divided ounces each, cut into 1-inch strips 1 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh oregano 14 cup chicken stock 1 1 tablespoon butter 4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley 3 tablespoons lemon juice 12 cup Roma tomatoes, diced 1 Salt and pepper to taste 4 cup white wine, divided 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 1 Combine the pepper, half the garlic, the salt, oregano, parsley, lemon juice, and half of the wine in a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken. Mix gently to coat the chicken with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for several hours (overnight is best).

2 When ready to cook the chicken, preheat the broiler, on low if your range has this setting. Remove the chicken from the marinade (save the remaining marinade) and place in a shallow pan. Broil 8 inches from the heat, turning once, until the chicken is no longer pink inside (about 15 minutes).

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 217 3 While the chicken is broiling, heat the olive oil in a saut pan. Saut the remaining garlic, until fragrant, but not browned. Add the remaining white wine to the saut pan and scrape to remove any bits on the pan. Add the remaining marinade and chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce the sauce by half. Stir in the butter and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Top with the Parmesan cheese.

A paillard (pronounced pie-yarhd) is a fancy French word that basically means a cutlet, or a slice of meat thats been pounded to a thin, even thickness (or thinness depending on your viewpoint). Some people call it a medallion (when theyre small) or scaloppine. This process has two benefits.

The meat cooks evenly, because there are no thicker or thinner sections.

The meat cooks fairly quickly because its thin.

Try this handy technique for yourself by taking a look at Figure 13-1 and following the next recipe.

218 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Paillard of Chicken Breast with Fennel and Parmigiano Laura Maioglio, owner of Barbetta Restaurant in New York City (see Appendix A), has provided this wonderful dish, to be enjoyed any time of the year. However, its perfect for the summer months, because its a light dish with fresh ingredients, and can be cooked on the barbecue, as well. The fennel and Parmigiano cheese offer two very opposing flavors but come together with the chive and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette.

The ingredients create deep layers of flavor, requiring very little added salt.

Notice that the skin has been removed prior to cooking the chicken. By searing the breasts in a hot pan, the juices become locked within the chickens crisp coat, keeping the breast from drying out.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes Yield: 4 servings 1 bunch fresh chives 114 pounds cherry tomatoes 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided Salt and pepper Pinch of salt 4 full boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1 bulb fennel 6 ounces each, pounded flat 4 cups baby arugula 3 ounces sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil, pured 4 ounces Parmigiano, sliced paper thin 2 lemons, halved 1 Chop the chives. In a blender, blend the chives with 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the pinch of salt.

2 Slice the fennel into paper-thin slices.

3 Arrange four dinner plates with baby arugula on one side and fennel slices layered with Parmigiano slices over arugula. Halve the cherry tomatoes and place on either side of the salad.

4 Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the chicken breasts.

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 219 5 Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan. When the pan is very hot, place the 4 chicken breasts in the pan. Cook the breasts until theyve acquired a golden color. Flip the breasts over and do the same to the other side. The breasts shouldnt cook more than 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Dont let the breasts become dry.

6 Place 1 chicken breast paillard on each plate next to the salad. Season with salt and pepper. With a spoon or squirt bottle, dribble the chive sauce and the tomatoes over and around the chicken breast paillards to create a colorful design.

7 Dress the salad plate with a drizzle of olive oil and a lemon half.

Tip: Fennel is a terrific herb you may not be familiar with. The thick bulb (sometimes called the head) has a thick, cabbagelike texture and the rich flavor and aroma of licorice. (You can see what fennel looks like in Chapter 9.) Save the stringy tops, which resemble dill weed, for a fun and unusual garnish.

Marinating chicken for hours or even overnight is a great way to maximize flavor and add moisture to chicken breasts. Make up your own marinades based on what youre in the mood for. Here are some ideas to get you started.

Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and oregano  Light soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced ginger  Lowfat salad dressing, like Italian or Greek vinaigrette Include an acid of some sort in your marinade to help break down some connective tissue in the meat, making it more tender and helping it to absorb the marinade flavor more completely. Good acid choices include citrus juice and vinegar. The marinade in the following recipe features lemon juice.

220 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Roast Free-Range Chicken Breast Stuffed with Porcini Mushrooms, Caramelized Leeks, and Pancetta This dish is fantastic (courtesy of the Baricelli Inn in Cleveland  see Appendix A) and surprisingly simple. Although you want to keep the skin on while cooking the chicken, be sure to remove it after you sit down to eat. The skin is full of artery-clogging saturated fat. You wont even need the skin when you taste the pancetta. Pancetta is essentially Italian bacon, although it has a higher fat content and slightly saltier flavor than traditional bacon. For this reason, use it in moderation, as more of a condiment, than a main ingredient in dishes. Just a small amount can impart a delicious smoky flavor.

To create the delightful sauce, you need to rehydrate dried mushrooms. Rehydrating is easy, but remember: Always strain the liquid used to rehydrate mushrooms before adding it to any recipe. Gently pour it through a coffee filter to remove any dirt or grit.

Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 50 minutes Yield: 4 servings 12 cup dried porcini mushrooms 4 chicken breasts, skin on, boned and tenders 2 cups warm water, divided removed, about 6 ounces each 3 sun-dried tomatoes Salt and pepper 4 ounces lean pancetta (approximately 8 thin 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme slices), diced 4 cups watercress, washed 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium leek, tough greens removed, rinsed 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar well, diced small 2 cups low-sodium chicken stock Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 221 1 Place the oven rack in the lower area of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set aside a large roasting pan.

2 Place the porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of warm water. Let rest for 15 minutes. Repeat the process in a separate cup of water with the sun-dried tomatoes. Strain the porcini from the water and reserve the water. Cut the mushrooms into fine juliennes. Strain the sun-dried tomatoes from the water and discard the water. Cut the tomatoes into fine juliennes.

3 Saut the pancetta in a pan until fat is rendered out, but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes.

4 Heat the butter in a small saut pan over medium heat. When hot, add the leeks and cook until lightly browned, about 412 minutes. Add the mushrooms, tomatoes, and pancetta to the saut pan.

5 To assemble the chicken breasts, pull the skin back and season both sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme on both sides. Spread about 12 cup of the mushroom mixture over each chicken breast. Cover with skin. Place in the reserved roasting pan. Top the chicken breasts with any additional stuffing mixture that is remaining.

6 Place in the oven and roast until browned, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a warm platter.

7 Toss the watercress with the olive oil and vinegar.

8 Deglaze the pan. Combine the porcini mushroom water and chicken stock in the pan used for the chicken. Simmer until reduced to 13 cup, about 6 to 8 minutes.

9 Serve the chicken breasts over the watercress and pour the sauce on top.

222 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Talking Turkey to Liven Up Your Meals A standard 312-ounce serving of white meat turkey, without the skin, has only a gram of saturated fat, which is even less than the same size serving of a chicken breast. Turkey is also a good source of B vitamins and many minerals, including iron, potassium, selenium, and zinc, especially in the dark meat.

If you buy a whole turkey, you tend to get more meat for your money by buying a larger bird. With a small bird, in the 12- to 15-pound range, much of what you get is bones, so you may be disappointed with the meager meat that results from all your hard work. If you have more leftovers than you can (or want to) eat in a couple of days, freeze the extra with a touch of chicken broth to help keep it moist.

Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 223 Rotisserie-Roasted Turkey Breast Rotisserie chicken is available in just about every grocery store in the country. Its a great convenience food, and a relatively healthy one as well. But if youre watching your salt intake, you may not be able to enjoy this tasty food regularly. Heather Dismore created this low-sodium version of the perennial favorite with turkey. Roast the turkey up out of its own fat (either on a rack or on foil balls) for a true rotisserie experience at home.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 2 hours and 15 minutes Yield: Varies based on weight of turkey, 6-ounce serving size 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 tablespoons lemon pepper 1 turkey breast, 6 to 7 pounds, with skin 1 tablespoon ground sage 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Rub the olive oil into the turkey breast. Place the turkey breast in a roasting pan with a rack. (If you dont have a rack, roll up 6 balls of foil and then place under the turkey in the roasting pan to elevate the turkey breast.) To get a rotisserie-like final product, you need to make sure the turkey doesnt sit in any fat as it cooks. Set aside.

2 In a small bowl, combine the lemon pepper and ground sage. Sprinkle the combined seasonings evenly over oiled turkey breast. Place the roasting pan in the oven. Cook for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. Then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees to finish cooking, approximately 112 hours, depending on the size of your bird. Cook the turkey until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees with a meat thermometer.

Tip: Use this easy dry rub on any poultry you like. Its great with chicken, Cornish game hens, capons, and game birds.

224 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Classic: Turkey Loaf with Portobello Sauce Meatloaf is a homey food that became chic in recent years. Youll find it served in trendy gourmet restaurants, a witty addition to elaborate menus. This recipe is a dressed-up version that calls for ground turkey and is topped with fancy portobello mushrooms, those meaty giants you can find in the produce section of most supermarkets. Have this meatloaf for dinner and then in a sandwich the next day for lunch.

Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 60 minutes Yield: 4 servings The meatloaf: 14 teaspoon nutmeg Nonstick cooking spray 14 teaspoon pepper 1 medium onion, minced The sauce: 1 stalk celery, minced 2 teaspoons unsalted margarine (see the tip at 1 pound lean ground turkey the end of the recipe) 1 1 large portobello mushroom, cleaned and cut 4 cup chopped parsley into small pieces (about 1 cup) 14 cup fine bread crumbs 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 14 cup skim milk 1 1 egg white, lightly beaten 8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 1 clove garlic, minced 8 teaspoon pepper 1 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 8 teaspoon salt Chapter 13: Flocking to Poultry 225 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2 For the meatloaf, coat a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and celery. Saut, stirring often, until translucent, about 5 minutes.

3 Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the turkey, parsley, bread crumbs, milk, egg white, garlic, thyme, nutmeg, and pepper. Add the onion and celery and mix well.

4 Form into a loaf and place in a well-coated loaf pan. Bake 50 minutes or until the internal temperature is 165 degrees.

5 For the sauce, melt the margarine in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Add the mushrooms. Saut, stirring, until tender.

6 Remove from the heat. Add the chicken broth, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Return to heat.

Cook until fragrant and slightly thickened, 5 minutes.

7 When the meatloaf is cooked, unmold, slice, and place portions on warmed dinner plates.

8 Ladle mushroom sauce over sliced turkey loaf.

Tip: Look for brands of margarine that arent made with hydrogenated oils, which contain trans fatty acids.

Tip: Ground turkey is a great substitute for ground beef. Choose ground turkey without skin, for the greatest savings in the saturated fat department. Use ground turkey anywhere youd use beef, such as pasta sauce, burgers, or casseroles.

Meat is also a source of B vitamins and many minerals needed for good health. In particular, it is an excellent source of vitamin B12, essential for normal functioning of the nervous system, and iron for transporting oxygen to the cells.

In this chapter, we show you three great techniques for cooking meats to fit in with a diabetic diet: searing, braising, and roasting. We give you great recipes for each technique and other tips along the way.

Always cook meats to a safe temperature for appropriate degree of doneness.

See Table 14-1 to find out what temperature to cook the meat of your choice.

228 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Table 14-1 Safe Cooking Temperatures for Meats Product Temperature (in degrees) Ground veal, beef, lamb, pork 160 Beef, medium rare 145 Beef, medium 160 Beef, wel done 170 Veal, medium rare 145 Veal, medium 160 Veal, wel done 170 Lamb, medium rare 145 Lamb, medium 160 Lamb, wel done 170 Pork, medium rare 145 Pork, medium 160 Pork, wel done 170 Ham, fresh (raw) 160 Ham, precooked (to reheat) 140 Searing Meats for Culinary Success A cooking technique called searing is particularly helpful for keeping meat as lowfat and delicious as possible. Searing subjects meat to extremely high heat on the stovetop for a short period of time. Usually you sear one side and then the other. The technique produces a beautifully caramelized skin on the meat and essentially seals in its juices. This process helps to retain the moisture content of the meat and therefore much of the flavor.

Veal tenderloin is a healthy option compared with many other cuts of meat that can be quite high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Because its naturally low in fat, cook veal quickly at high temperatures to keep as many of the natural juices as possible. Searing veal is a great choice.

Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats 229 Veal Tenderloin with Chanterelle Mushrooms in a Muscat Veal Reduction Sauce A medallion is a small, coin-shaped piece of meat. Medallions are very thin, so once you sear them, you dont need to finish them in the oven. With just a short searing time, youll create perfectly tender slices of veal. Serve this terrific recipe, from Baricelli Inn in Cleveland (see Appendix A), with cavatelli pasta and the Haricot Vert from Chapter 11, also contributed by the Baricelli Inn.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Yield: 4 servings 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper (plus more 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to taste) 4 ounces wild mushrooms (chanterelle if 4 veal tenderloin medallions, approximately 6 available) ounces each (silver skin removed), pounded 2 ounces Muscat wine thin (check out Chapter 13 for details on pounding meat into cutlets) Salt to taste 1 6 ounces veal reduction sauce (reduced veal 2 cup flour stock, also known as demi-glace) 1 Press 12 teaspoon black pepper into each veal medallion and dredge in the flour.

2 Heat a medium saut pan over high heat. Add olive oil; sear the medallions on both sides (about 4 minutes on each side). Remove the medallions and set aside.

3 To the same saut pan, add the mushrooms, Muscat, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon pepper, and veal stock and cook for 2 minutes over high heat. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.

Pour the mixture over the veal slices.

Tip: If you cant find veal reduction sauce in your grocery store, check online or at Williams-Sonoma.

If you sear a thicker piece of meat like a chop or even a roast, quickly sear the outside and then finish the meat in the oven. Searing seals in the natural juices, and roasting finishes the cooking process to desired perfection. Check out Table 14-1, earlier in this chapter, for tips on choosing the right temperature for your taste and your cut of meat.

230 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Pan-Roasted Veal Chops with Corn and Gouda Ragout Chef Kevin Rathbun of Rathbuns in Atlanta (see Appendix A) offers another dish burst-ing with flavor that wont break the days calorie bank. The original recipe contains a bit more salt than we can recommend, so we made some minor modifications. But dont worry. You wont miss a thing  the dish remains full of other herbs and ingredients that offer intense flavors and great taste.

A ragout (pronounced ra-goo) is a thick, flavorful stewlike concoction that usually features meat and sometimes features vegetables. In this recipe, pan-roasted corn is paired with creamy Gouda cheese. Its great with the delicate veal medallions.

Preparation time: 1 hour and 15 minutes Cooking time: 45 minutes Yield: 4 servings Steak seasoning: 1 tablespoon chopped scallions 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 teaspoon pepper 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon minced garlic 14 cup grated Gouda cheese 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage Veal chops: Corn ragout: 4 veal chops, 7 ounces each 2 cups yellow corn kernels, fresh or frozen 2 tablespoons steak seasoning (see Step 1) 12 tablespoon minced garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup milk 1 To prepare the steak seasoning, preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Place the salt, pepper, garlic, and sage into a food processor and process 15 seconds. Transfer to an oven-safe dish and place in the oven for 30 minutes. After the garlic dries out, transfer back to the food processor and process 15 seconds. Set the seasoning aside. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees.

Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats 231 2 To make the ragout: Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat, at least 5 to 6 minutes. Add the corn and continue to cook until it becomes charred, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.

Add the garlic, milk, scallions, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.

Reserve.

3 Heat a large ovenproof saut pan over high heat. Season the veal chops with the prepared steak seasoning. Add the olive oil to the heated skillet. Sear the chops in the olive oil until golden brown on both sides, approximately 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the 400-degree oven and roast until desired doneness. Check out Table 14-1 to find the right temperature for you and test your chops with a meat thermometer.

4 When ready to serve, place the corn ragout on plates and sprinkle the Gouda cheese over the corn. Place the veal chops on top of the corn and serve.

Understanding the Basics of Braising Braising is a terrific cooking method for meats, vegetables, and anything else you want to make tender and tasty. Basically, braising involves cooking a cut of meat in a small amount of liquid. The meat gently cooks and steams, or braises, at the same time. Braising is particularly effective for less expensive cuts of meat, because you cook it slowly and break down the tougher muscle over time.

Braising is also a great cooking method because it requires very little use of added fats, such as butter and oil. You can braise foods either in the oven or in a pot on the stove. Try it out with the following great recipe.

232 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Beer-Braised Pork and Crisp-Herb Cabbage with Apple-Tarragon Dipping Sauce Chef Tom Wolfe, from Peristyle in New Orleans (see Appendix A), has developed this diabetic-friendly dish (shown in the color section). Pork comes from a pig, so it must be high in fat, right? Well actually, thats only half true. In recent years, pork has gained attention as the other white meat. As it turns out, the fat content of pork depends on the cut of the meat. The rump and rib roast, for example, are much higher in fat and cholesterol than the pork tenderloin, boneless sirloin chops, or boneless loin roasts. In this dish, try to use a lean cut of pork, such as the tenderloin, which is a naturally tender cut of meat and will remain moist from the slow-cook method of braising.

Preparation time: 1 hour and 45 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour Yield: 6 servings 14 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon melted butter 14 tablespoon black pepper 214 cups amber beer 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 212 tablespoons canola oil 2 tablespoons minced shallots 1 pound pork tenderloin sliced into 12 1-inch 1 tablespoon chopped garlic medallions 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 red pepper, julienned 1 Combine the kosher salt, pepper, soy sauce, shallots, garlic, mustard, butter, and beer.

Marinate the pork in this mixture in a resealable plastic bag in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes prior to cooking.

2 Heat the oil in a medium-hot large saut pan. Add the pork medallions, reserving the marinade, and cook until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

3 Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the reserved marinade and the red pepper.

Simmer on low, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes. Sauce should be reduced by one-half.

4 To serve, place the cabbage (see the next recipe) on a warm plate. Place 2 pork medallions next to the mound of cabbage. Pour the dipping sauce (see the accompanying recipe) into a ramekin and place it next to the pork and cabbage.

Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats 233 Crisp-Herb Cabbage 1 head cabbage, thinly shredded 14 cup white vinegar 1 medium red onion, julienned 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 1 2 tablespoon chopped garlic (about 2 cloves) 2 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes 12 cup chopped parsley 2 packets Splenda 1 1 4 cup chopped fresh basil 2 teaspoon allspice 11 1 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 2 teaspoon ground coriander 12 cup rice vinegar (seasoned) Juice from 2 lemons 1 Combine the cabbage, onion, garlic, parsley, basil, and thyme in a large mixing bowl.

2 Combine the rice vinegar and white vinegar in a small bowl. Add to the cabbage mixture.

3 Add the salt, red pepper flakes, Splenda, allspice, coriander, and lemon juice to the bowl and mix ingredients well.

234 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Recommending Roasting Roasting is a simple technique that requires little effort. Season meat with herbs and spices and cook it in the oven until it reaches a desired degree of doneness. You just need to ensure that the meat doesnt dry out, a possibility with this dry-heat method of cooking. Here are some suggestions:  Slow-roast meat at a low temperature, 350 degrees and below.

Wrap meat in foil for most of the cooking time and remove only for the last half hour of cooking  to allow the meat to brown.

Cook roasts with the bone still attached, when possible, because the meat cooks faster and has more flavor that way.

Try roasting lamb with the next recipe. Leave the bones on the chops for quicker cooking and a beautiful presentation.

Roasted Lamb Sirloin with Herbes de Provence, Spinach, and Onion Ragout with Lamb Au Jus Herbes de Provence is simply a mix of herbs commonly used in southern French cooking. They happen to go wonderfully well with this lamb dish, by Chef Didier Labbe from the Clementine restaurant in San Francisco (see Appendix A). Lamb is typically one of those meats with more fat, so do your best to choose a leaner cut, like the sirloin.

Choose cuts with the least amount of white marbling, (or fat) within the meat and, as with all meat dishes, remember to trim excess fat whenever possible!

The ragout contributes a wonderful flavor to the lamb and spinach, and the only ingredient is onion! Be creative with your blender  you can make many wonderful, flavorful sauces and spreads by using just a single fruit or vegetable.

Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour Yield: 4 servings 4 lamb sirloin chops, 6 ounces each 2 cups water 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 bunch spinach 1 1 4 cup herbes de Provence 2 cup port wine Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons butter 3 white onions, sliced Chapter 14: Creating Balanced Meals with Meats 235 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

2 Place the lamb sirloin chops in a roasting pan. Spread the Dijon mustard evenly over the lamb chops. Sprinkle on herbes de Provence and lightly salt and pepper. Drizzle lightly with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and roast 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and continue roasting until the chops are medium rare (light pink inside), or when a meat thermometer inserted in the center of a chop reaches 145 degrees.

3 While the chops are cooking, combine the onions and water in a large saut pan or 3-quart saucepan. Cover and simmer until the onions become soft. Remove the onions from the pan and process them in a food processor until theyre smooth.

4 In the same saut pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the spinach. Cover and cook the spinach for about 3 to 4 minutes. Fold the onion pure into the spinach, season it lightly with salt and pepper, and set it aside, but keep warm.

5 Remove the chops from the roasting pan to another dish and cover them with foil to keep them warm.

6 Place the baking pan on the stove. On low heat, deglaze the pan by adding the port wine, garlic, and butter. Reduce the mixture by one-fourth.

7 To serve, place the spinach mixture in the middle of each plate. Place one lamb chop on top of the spinach and pour the port wine sauce over it.

Chapter 15: Having a Little Bite with Snacks 245 Quick Chicken Tostadas Mexican food is often considered to be pretty high in fat and cholesterol, but it doesnt have to be. In fact, common ingredients in Mexican cooking, such as beans, chicken, olives, and tomatoes, are very healthy. Not so good, on the other hand, are fried tortillas, extra cheese, and high-fat sour cream. If you have a craving for nachos or quesadillas, traditionally very high in calories and saturated fat, try these light tostadas instead, courtesy of Heather Dismore. Theyre full of flavor and incorporate traditional Mexican ingredients but have half the calories and fat. When preparing tacos or other Mexican-style dishes at home, be sparing with the toppings (cheese, sour cream, and guacamole), which contribute the most significant amount of calories and fat.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes Yield: 6 servings 6 whole-wheat flour tortillas Salt and pepper Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese 34 pound cooked chicken (see the tip at the 1 tablespoon minced cilantro or green onions end of the recipe) (optional) 34 cup salsa 2 tablespoons minced black olives (optional) 14 teaspoon cayenne pepper 6 tablespoons lowfat sour cream (optional) 14 teaspoon chili powder 3 tablespoons prepared guacamole (optional) 1 cup diced red pepper 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray each tortilla lightly with cooking spray. Place prepared tortillas on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Toast the tortillas until crisp, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees.

2 Mix the chicken, salsa, cayenne pepper, chili powder, red pepper, and salt and pepper to taste together in a mixing bowl. Top each tostada with one-sixth of the chicken mixture.

3 For each tostada, top the chicken mixture with one-sixth of the cheddar cheese. Return the tostadas to the oven. Cook until the chicken is heated through and the cheese is melted, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

4 If desired, top each tostada with 12 teaspoon cilantro or green onions, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and 1 teaspoon black olives.

Tip: For this recipe, you can purchase roasted chicken breast, or you can cook the chicken breast yourself by poaching it, which means cooking it in water just below the boiling point until it is cooked through (no longer pink inside).

You get all the Italian flavor without any traditional pasta and the costly carbs.

248 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Spinach-Ricotta Gnocchi Heres a great twist on the traditional gnocchi, or potato pasta. Chef Christopher Fernandez at Poggio in Sausalito, California (see Appendix A), has creatively substituted the white flour base to this usually high-carbohydrate food for ricotta cheese, a significant source of protein. In doing so, the gnocchi will have far less of an effect on your blood sugars and allow you to once again eat what you might have once considered sinful! Enjoy this with your favorite red Italian pasta sauce.

Special tools: Cheesecloth, pastry bag Preparation time: 1 hour Cooking time: 4 to 5 minutes Yield: 4 servings 12 pound part-skim ricotta cheese Pinch ground nutmeg 1 gallon water Salt to taste 14 pound fresh spinach 2 tablespoons potato starch 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon dehydrated potato flakes 1 egg, beaten 2 tablespoons plus 2 cups flour 1 Place the ricotta in a strainer lined with cheesecloth and let sit overnight in the refrigerator to remove excess liquid.

2 Bring the 1 gallon of water to a boil, add the spinach, and boil for 30 seconds. Strain the spinach and place the spinach on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the spinach in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, squeeze out all the excess water from the spinach. Chop the spinach as fine as you can on a cutting board. This may take some time, but the finer the better.

3 To make the gnocchi, place the chopped spinach, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Mix until the spinach has been evenly distributed, and add the potato starch, dehydrated potato, and 2 tablespoons of the flour to bind the mixture. Bring a small pot of water to a boil and drop a spoon-sized piece of gnocchi to test the consistency and flavor. If the gnocchi is too wet and falls apart, add another egg and some flour. The key to this gnocchi is to add the minimum amount of binder so that the gnocchi are as light as possible.

4 Place a 6-quart pot on the stove with plenty of salted water to boil the gnocchi. Bring the water to a boil and turn down until youre ready to cook the gnocchi.

Chapter 15: Having a Little Bite with Snacks 249 5 Place the remaining 2 cups of flour in a long baking pan. Shake the flour evenly around in the pan. Place the gnocchi mixture into a pastry bag with a large straight tip about 12 inch in diameter. Pipe the gnocchi mixture in a long line directly into the flour, as if you were making a long snakelike piece. You can make a couple of lines like this in the flour.

6 With a knife, cut the snakelike pieces into 1-inch pieces. With your hands, gently cover the gnocchi lightly with flour, shake off any excess flour, and place directly into boiling salt water. Cook the gnocchi for at least 5 minutes or until they float for 2 minutes.

Remove from the water.

Tip: You can serve these immediately or hold them for later use. If you plan to hold the gnocchi, place the cooked gnocchi onto a lightly oiled sheet pan and place in the refrigerator. Once cooled, you can place the gnocchi in an airtight container until ready to use. You can reheat the gnocchi in boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes.

Even though diabetes is a disease that involves impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, you can still enjoy desserts that contain starches and sugar. You just need to select your ingredients wisely and eat reasonably modest portions. But dont waste time feeling guilty because you cant stay away from sweets. Sweet is one of the basic tastes, just like sour and salty, and craving sweet foods is normal.

Of course, people crave sweets such as cookies, jelly doughnuts, pies, and candy made with refined white flour and white sugar, which provide little nutrition. Enriched white flour has had a significant portion of the nutrients in the original whole grain removed, and white sugar contains no vitamins or minerals at all.

In this chapter, we show you how to create appealing desserts that feature nutritious ingredients. We help you satisfy your cravings for sweet foods, including chocolate. We introduce a healthful sweetener, agave nectar, to flavor desserts the right way. And we give you a host of different presentations to impress your guests.

252 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Finding a New Take on Fruit Diabetic desserts have long consisted of sugar-free gelatin and fruit. Theres certainly nothing wrong with that, but if youre bored with the standard take on fruit, we have several recipes that help you improve upon that old standard, fruit, and give it an update youd be proud to serve to anyone.

T Spiced Infusion with Tropical Fruits Tobi Sovak, pastry chef at Dereks Bistro in Los Angeles (see Appendix A), gives you a way to enjoy a treat without all the sugar that comes with most sweets! Be aware that this dish still contains carbs, and like everything else, enjoying it in moderation is key.

Ginger and lemon brighten the sweet flavors of the cantaloupe and papaya in the following recipe. Choose cantaloupes that are heavy for their size and have a lightly sweet melon fragrance. A cantaloupe should be firm but give slightly when pressed. Avoid melons with mushy spots or discolorations.

The papaya is a large pear-shaped tropical fruit. It contains a bed of large peppery seeds in the center of the fruit. If youre looking for a ripe papaya to use immediately or refrigerate, choose richly colored papayas, with splotches of bright yellow, green, and some orange. Green papayas will ripen in a few days if left at room temperature and placed in a brown paper bag.

254 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great T Cantaloupe-Papaya Salad with Ginger Simple Syrup Chef Kyle Ketchum of The Lark in West Bloomfield, Michigan (see Appendix A), offers this fruity dessert sure to please the taste buds. Its a simple recipe, using simple syrup.

Simple syrup is made from sugar and water; here, however, we substitute Splenda  the non-sugar sweetener  for the same amount of sugar. Enjoy the natural fruit flavors of these antioxidant-packed fruits with a little something extra drizzled lightly on top.

Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes Yield: 6 servings Syrup: Fruit salad: 14 cup (18 packets) Splenda 1 cantaloupe 12 cup water 2 papayas 2 inches fresh gingerroot, peeled 4 mint sprigs 1 tablespoon lemon zest 1 Bring the Splenda and water to a boil in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the ginger and reduce the heat, allowing the liquid to simmer.

2 Stir until the Splenda dissolves and the ginger infuses the syrup, about 2 minutes.

Remove the pan from heat and take out the ginger. Allow the syrup to cool at room temperature. Add the lemon zest.

3 Scoop out the meat of the fruits with a melon baller and then toss it with the simple syrup and mint when youre ready to serve it.

Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet 255 T Pears Baked in Red Wine alla Piemontese This recipe, courtesy of Barbetta in New York City (see Appendix A), is a classic way of preparing pears in Piemonte, Italys northwesternmost region. The pears should be baked until the skins turn brown and crinkly  strafugna as they would say in the Piemontese dialect. Here, we substitute Splenda for sugar, which causes the pears to lack the almost candied taste of the traditional preparation. Splenda, however, is a natural-tasting artificial sweetener, so youll still be satisfied with the pears flavor. Keep in mind, however, that since fruit and wine have natural sugars, we cant completely dis-count the carbohydrate content of this dish, which (per serving) is equivalent to almost 3 starch servings. Consider enjoying this delightful dessert after a meal low in starch and only on occasion.

Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 112 hours, plus cooling time Yield: 4 servings 10 ounces dry red wine Juice of 2 lemons 7 cloves 1 cup Splenda 1 cinnamon stick 4 large Bosc pears, unpeeled 1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

2 Pour the wine into a 9-inch-square baking pan. Add the cloves, cinnamon, lemon juice, and Splenda and stir until the Splenda dissolves. Add the pears to the pan. Place them in the oven and bake for 112 hours, brushing the pears with wine from the pan every 10 minutes.

3 Remove the pears from the oven. Allow them to cool at room temperature and serve.

256 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Juicing Your Way to Tasty and Healthy Treats Fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so all the natural sugars can really affect your blood sugar without all the fiber to slow it down. But with a little diligence, you can use fruit juice to flavor your desserts and still maintain your blood sugar levels.

T Cranberry-Raspberry Granita This refreshing treat, courtesy of Heather Dismore (and shown in the color section), makes for a sweet dessert  except it doesnt have any added sugar. Raspberries and cranberries are some of the best sources of antioxidants, and you dont even have to wait for summer to take advantage of these nutritional powerhouses. Most berries are available in frozen food sections of supermarkets and have all the great nutrition of their fresh versions.

Preparation time: 6 hours and 30 minutes, mostly unattended Yield: 6 servings 2 cups 100% juice cranberry-raspberry juice 12 cup Splenda sugar substitute blend 1 12 cups raspberries (fresh or previously frozen, thawed, and drained) 1 In a blender, combine the juice and raspberries. Mix well. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve placed over a mixing bowl. Press the mixture gently through the sieve, as necessary, to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the mixture in the sieve or reserve for another use.

2 Add the Splenda to the strained juice mixture and stir to mix well. Cover and freeze. Stir thoroughly with a fork about every 30 minutes, for 6 hours or so, or until the granita is frozen in a crumbly, grainy texture.

Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet 257 Citrus fruits in particular make great juice choices for adding to desserts.

Their strong flavors mean a little can go a long way. And many are tart rather than sweet, so they naturally have few sugars. For the scoop on how to juice your own citrus, check out Chapter 7.

Taking Advantage of Agave Nectar Agave nectar is a delicious natural sweetener with a flavor similar to honey.

Its derived from the same plant that gives us tequila. Compared to other sweeteners, it has a low glycemic index. It provides sweetness without the sugar rush (and subsequent crash) of refined sugars. Used in moderation, it can be part of a healthy diabetic diet.

Additionally, agave nectar, sometimes called agave syrup, is full of other health benefits, including improving bacterial balance in the gut. When mixed with salt, its a beneficial treatment for wound care. Inulin, one of the components of agave, may help lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of some cancers, and improve the absorption of nutrients, like isoflavones, calcium, and magnesium.

Brown Rice Pudding Sublime (www.sublimerestaurant.com) located in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, brings you this twist on a traditional dessert favorite. Brown rice, because it retains its bran, has more fiber than white rice and takes longer to cook, so definitely allow extra time during the initial cooking phase.

Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 1 hour 45 minutes Yield: 6 servings 1 1 1 4 cups brown rice 2 cup raisins 3 cups soymilk 2 teaspoons agave nectar 12 cup golden raisins 1 Cook rice according to package directions, stirring often.

2 Combine the cooked rice with the soymilk, raisins, and agave nectar. Cover and cook the mixture over low heat for 1 hour, until most of the soymilk has evaporated and the rice is creamy.

Choosing Chocolate for Dessert What would life be without chocolate? Fortunately, you wont have to specu-late or even discover the situation for yourself. Mix up your own tasty chocolate concoctions by substituting your favorite no-calorie sweetener for the regular sugar.

And whenever possible, choose the highest-quality cocoa powder you can afford. The flavor is much better, and since youre only having a small portion anyway, you definitely want the best-tasting bite you can get!

Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet 259 Mixing up some meringues Meringue, essentially egg whites flavored and whipped to foamy peaks, is an extremely versatile food. You can create little clouds to hold fresh fruit, top a fruit pie, or even use it to cover a pound cake and ice cream (to create baked Alaska). Meringue is naturally lowfat and takes on the flavor of any extracts, like almond, mint, or chocolate, so experiment and enjoy!

T Chocolate Meringue Bits with Strawberries and Cream These little meringues, courtesy of Heather Dismore, are a surefire way to satisfy your chocolate cravings without all the calories and fat. We flavor them with cocoa powder and Splenda to give fantastic flavor. And the texture of these lite bites is outstanding.

Top with fresh strawberries for a dash of fiber and vitamin C.

Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus standing time of 8 hours or overnight Cooking time: 1 hour and 30 minutes Yield: 40 112-inch meringues 4 egg whites 13 cup cocoa powder 14 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 cup reduced-fat tub-style whipped topping 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 40 strawberries 23 cup Splenda 1 Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

2 Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and vanilla at high speed with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the Splenda, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form, roughly 5 to 7 minutes. Gently fold in the cocoa powder until completely incorporated.

3 Spoon heaping tablespoons of the mixture onto the baking sheets. Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes; turn the oven off. Let the meringues stand in the closed oven for 8 hours or overnight. Store in an airtight container.

4 Just before serving, top each meringue with 1 scant teaspoon of whipped topping and a strawberry.

260 Part II: Healthy Recipes That Taste Great Enjoying a coffee break Coffee is one of the most available beverages in society these days. You cant even take a stroll through your local grocery store or mall without being assaulted by the aromas of your local coffee roaster. And fortunately, most of them offer delicious decaffeinated versions of these aromatic beverages.

Steam up a little nonfat milk to go with it, and youre ready to relax for a few minutes.

For a decadent but diabetic-friendly coffee break, make your own decaf, nonfat coffee drink (sweetened with sugar-free sweeteners, of course) and pair it with our delicious, crunchy biscotti.

Chocolate-Almond Biscotti Biscotti are a great treat, and now you can enjoy them homemade, and without all the calories and sugar. This rendition of the Italian biscuit (courtesy of Heather Dismore) is easy to make and takes no time. Its also half the calories and carbohydrates of the usual crusty cookie. See these treats in the color section.

Preparation time: 1 hour Cooking time: 45 minutes Yield: 20 servings Nonstick cooking spray 18 teaspoon salt 1 1 2 cup almonds, toasted and roughly chopped 2 cup Splenda for Baking 12 cup all-purpose flour 1 egg 13 cup whole-wheat flour 1 egg white 14 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons instant coffee crystals 1 teaspoon almond extract 12 teaspoon baking soda 1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray.

2 In a food processor, combine 14 cup of the almonds and the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, cocoa powder, coffee crystals, baking soda, and salt. Process until the nuts are finely ground, approximately 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.

Chapter 16: Smart Ways to Include Dessert in a Diabetic Diet 261 3 In the food processor, combine the Splenda, egg, egg white, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Mix until the mixture is slightly thickened, roughly 2 minutes. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture in the mixing bowl. Stir in the remaining 14 cup almonds.

4 Use half the batter to form a log (approximately 5 to 7 inches long) on one-half of the foil-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough on other half of the baking sheet. Bake until firm, approximately 15 minutes. Cool approximately 10 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.

5 Place the logs on a cutting board. Using a serrated bread knife, cut each log into approximately 10 12-inch diagonal slices. Return the slices to the baking sheets. Bake until the cut sides feel dry to the touch, approximately 20 minutes. Cool completely and store in an airtight container.

The chapters in this part tell you how to eat well and stay healthy wherever you are. You can always visit a fast-food franchise, but a lot of that food isnt good for you. So in these chapters, I help you to pick and choose well. That way, you can select a meal even when your only choice is the one fast-food restaurant off the next exit on the freeway.

Contents Making Eating Out a Nourishing Chapter 17 Experience 265 Making Eating Out a Nourishing Preparing for Restaurant Dining 266 Experience Beginning the Dining Experience 267 In This Chapter  Preparing to go to a restaurant  Taking your seat Ordering from the Menu 268  Checking the menu  Managing your eating at each meal and in different kinds of restaurants  Finding ways to enjoy your food Planning at Each Meal and in  Considering dessert Specific Kinds of Restaurants 270 Enjoying Your Food 273 People eat many of their meals in restaurants these days, so integrating restaurant eating into a nutritional plan is essential for a person with diabetes. The restaurant business is booming, and creative chefs have the same celebrity status as famous sports stars. And they deserve it. They use fresh ingredients to produce some of the most delicious and unique tastes imaginable. Unfortunately, nutrition isnt always uppermost in their minds.

Finishing with Dessert 274 Our experience with the many chefs in this book proves that interest in good nutrition is increasing, but youre still on your own most of the time when selecting healthy foods. This chapter helps you ensure that your restaurant eating fits well into your nutritional plan.

Your situation may be much like the plight of the customer who called the waiter over and said, Waiter, taste this soup. The waiter replied, Is there something wrong with it? Never mind, said the customer, just taste the soup. But it smells and looks okay, said the waiter. Thats all right, just taste the soup, replied the customer. But sir, theres no spoon, said the waiter. Aha, said the customer. Or you may be like the diner who complains to the waiter, Waiter, I cant find any steak in this steak pie. The waiter replies, Well, theres no horse in the horseradish either. And if you find a fly in your soup, thank the waiter for the extra protein but ask him to serve it separately. The point is that you are ultimately responsible to ensure that you know what is in the food you order and make healthy choices.

266 Part III: Eating Away from Home Preparing for Restaurant Dining If you live in (or are visiting) one of the cities that contains a restaurant we reference in this book (see Appendix A), the task of finding a restaurant that is appropriate for a person with diabetes is much easier for you. The chefs who have contributed to this book are health-conscious. They make an effort to keep the fat and the sugar low. But they have to respond to what they perceive to be their customers needs. They think that one of the main needs is for a lot of food, so your portions will almost always be larger than necessary.

You have to evaluate the food you order by questioning your waitperson carefully. Even if the balance of energy sources is right, you will probably receive too much food and should take some home or leave some on your plate.

Because this book is limited to certain cities and restaurants, you may often find yourself having to choose a restaurant where you dont know the ingredients in the food or whether the menu items are healthy or not. How do you go about choosing a restaurant in this situation? Here are a few suggestions:  No particular kind of food is better or worse than any other, with the exception of fast food (we discuss this issue in Chapter 18). You may think that vegetarian food is better than animal sources, but a dish of pasta in a creamy sauce is no better than a piece of fatty steak. Often, restaurants have several menu items that fit into your nutrition plan.

Consider choosing a restaurant that you can walk to and from. The exercise you get will offset the extra calories you may consume.

Many restaurants now publish their menus on the Internet. Before deciding to visit a particular restaurant, go to the establishments Web site and make sure that it serves food you can eat.

Dont go to the restaurant if the catch of the day is fish sticks.

Call ahead and find out whether you can substitute items on the menu.

Nonfranchise and non-fast-food restaurants are much more likely to let you substitute menu items. Fast-food restaurants are able to serve large numbers of people at lower prices by making the food entirely uniform.

On the other hand, as Chapter 18 explains, this uniformity makes it easier to know the exact ingredients and methods of preparation. You need to ask only a few questions to know whether a restaurant will be accommodating. Ask whether the staff will  Substitute skim milk for whole milk.

Reduce the amount of butter and sugar in a dish.

Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience 267  Serve gravies, salad dressings, and sauces on the side.

Bake, broil, and poach instead of frying or sauting.

An older restaurant has the advantage of having experienced and well-trained waitstaff who know what the kitchen staff are willing to do for you, based on what has been done before.

Find out whether the restaurant already has special meals or entrees for people with chronic diseases such as heart disease. Theyre much more likely to be health conscious in their cooking.

When you choose a restaurant, consider what youve already eaten that day. For example, if youve already eaten your daily limit of carbohydrate, then the choice of a restaurant where pasta or rice is the major ingredient may not be a good one. People often choose a restaurant days in advance, so if you know ahead where youll be dining, you can plan to modify your eating accordingly earlier in the day, especially if the restaurant specializes in foods you should eat in small quantities.

Drink water or have a vegetable snack before you go to the restaurant so that hunger wont drive you to make bad choices.

If you know that the restaurant serves huge portions of everything, dont go there unless you plan to share your meal or take part of your meal home.

Mrs. Wilson, who has type 2 diabetes, decided to go to a well-known delica-tessen before she attended a musical play. She knew that they served huge portions, but she also knew that she could order a mini-version of many of the items. At the restaurant, she ordered a mini-Reuben sandwich, expecting to get half or less of the usual entree. What arrived was the entire Reuben sandwich without the usual potato salad and coleslaw. She couldnt take half of it home because she was going directly to the show. She knew that shed feel bad leaving part of such a delicious sandwich, so she ended up eating most of it. Her blood glucose level later that night reflected the huge excess in calories that she had consumed.

You can see from the information in this section that you can do plenty, even before you reach the restaurant, to prepare for dining out. Your preparation may make the whole experience much more satisfying and less frustrating.

Beginning the Dining Experience As you sit down to enjoy your meal, you can take many steps to make the experience of eating out the pleasure that it ought to be. A few simple considerations at this point allow you to enjoy the meal free of the concern that you are wrecking your nutritional program. Among the steps that you can take are the following: 268 Part III: Eating Away from Home  If you arrive early, avoid sitting in the bar with cocktails before you move to your table to eat your meal.

Ask the hostess to seat you promptly so you dont have to wait and get too hungry or even hypoglycemic.

Ask your waiter not to bring bread or to take it off the table if it is there already. That goes for chips and crackers as well.

Ask for raw vegetables without a dip, what the restaurant menus call crudits, so you can munch on something before you order.

Check your blood glucose before you order so youll know how much carbohydrate is appropriate at that time.

Wait to administer your short-acting insulin until you can be sure of the food delivery time.

Mr. Phillips, a 63-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, was trying to understand, with the help of his dietitian, why his blood glucose had risen to 386 mg/dl after a meal at a local Mexican restaurant. I knew the portions were large, so I ordered a bean tortilla, and I didnt even eat the whole thing. I left half of it on my plate. I ate very little of the rice as well. The dietitian asked him if he had arrived early at the restaurant. Oh yes, I forgot. I had to wait in the bar, and I had a virgin margarita. That, said the dietitian, explains your high blood glucose. The margarita is all carbohydrate.

Ordering from the Menu The regular menu and the specials of the day or season are arranged to encourage you to order a big meal. One of the more interesting things that we learned as a result of working with the chefs whose recipes are found in this book, especially the European chefs now cooking in the United States, is the expectation of large portions on the part of U.S. restaurant-goers, compared to Europeans. The chefs were amazed at how much food they had to put on each plate to satisfy U.S. tastes. When you order meat, fish, or poultry, you often get at least twice as much as the recommended serving. Considering how frequently people eat out in the United States, its no wonder the population is getting fatter.

Your strategy for ordering from the menu should include the following:  Plan to leave some food or take home half your order, because the portions are always too large. You can also order a dish to share with another person.

If you decide to have wine, order it by the glass. Diners almost always finish a bottle of wine, and unless eight of you share the bottle, youll drink too much.

Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience 269  Consider using an appetizer as your entree.

Feel free to get a complete description, including portion size, of an appetizer or entree from the waitperson so that you arent surprised when the food arrives. Pay particular attention to how the food is cooked  in fat or butter, for example.

Consider a meal of soup and salad. This combination can be delicious, filling, low in calories, and low in carbohydrates.

Order clear soups rather than cream soups.

Ask for salad dressings and sauces on the side if possible. This way, you are in control of the amount you consume.

Youre probably wise to choose fish more often than meat, both to avoid fat and to take advantage of the cholesterol-lowering properties of fish.

Remember, however, that fried fish can be as fat-laden as a steak.

Let your server know that you need to eat soon. If your food will be delayed because the kitchen is slow or busy, insist that vegetable snacks be brought to the table.

The description of an entree usually offers clues that tell you whether its a good choice for you. These words, in particular, indicate that the preparation keeps fat to a minimum:  Baked  Blackened  Broiled  Cooked in its own juice  Grilled  Poached On the other hand, the following words point to a less desirable high-fat entree:  Battered  Buttered or in butter sauce  Creamed or in cream sauce  Deep-fried  Escalloped  Fried  Golden brown  In a plum sauce 270 Part III: Eating Away from Home  In cheese sauce  Sauted  Sweet-and-sour  With peanuts or cashews Does it really matter if you order one kind of sauce versus another? Here are the calorie counts per tablespoon for various salad dressings. Remember that the energy in food is properly expressed in kilocalories, not calories, which are a thousand times smaller:  Blue cheese: 82 kilocalories  Creamy Italian dressing: 52 kilocalories  Lowfat French dressing: 22 kilocalories  Red-wine vinegar: 2 kilocalories Planning at Each Meal and in Specific Kinds of Restaurants You can make good choices at every meal, whether its breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Every kind of food offers you the opportunity to select a lowfat, low-salt alternative. You just need to think about it and be aware of the possibilities. Helping you choose healthy meals is the purpose of this section.

When you go to any one of the ethnic restaurants discussed here, take a look at the waiters and waitresses. Are they overweight or obese? Usually theyre not, yet they eat the food youre about to eat on a regular basis. This means you can order food in this restaurant and know that you have plenty of good healthy choices. (Check out Chapter 4 for an introduction to ethnic foods and how to prepare them yourself.) Breakfast The good choices at breakfast are fresh foods, which usually contain plenty of fiber. Fresh fruit and juice are good ways to start the meal, followed by hot cereals such as oatmeal or Wheatena, or high-fiber cold cereals such as shredded wheat or bran cereals. Always add skim milk or 1 percent fat milk instead of whole milk. Enjoy egg whites but not yolks, or make an omelet with two whites for every yolk.

Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience 271 Less desirable choices are foods such as quiche, bacon, fried or hash brown potatoes, croissants, pastries, and doughnuts. And be careful of the high calorie coffees. According to Starbucks own Web site, a Strawberries and Crme Frappuccino Blended Crme-Whip has 570 kilocalories, including 130 kilocalories of fat.

Appetizers, salads, and soups Raw and plain food beats those cooked and covered with butter or sour cream, and that rule applies to appetizers, salads, and soups, too. Raw carrots and celery can be enjoyed at any time and to almost any extent. Clear soups are always healthier. Salsa has become a popular accompaniment for crackers and chips instead of a high-fat dip. A delicious green salad is nutritious and filling.

By contrast, olives, nachos, and avocados have lots of fat. Nuts, chips, and cheese before dinner add lots of calories. Fried onion appetizers are currently very popular, and theyre often dripping with fat. Watch out for the sour cream dips and the mayonnaise dips, since they, too, are full of fat.

Vegetarian food As the population gets increasingly obese, there has been a trend to go to vegetarian restaurants. What is called vegetarian varies from no dairy products at all, which is referred to as vegans (people who use no animal products of any kind) to eating eggs and/or dairy. Vegans diets can provide all the nutritional needs of a patient, but must be carefully planned to do so.

Alternatively, vegans dieters can take supplements of calcium, iodine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D.

Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy but not eggs while lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat eggs and milk. Semi-vegetarians eat some fish and poultry as well.

Wherever you fit in the continuum of vegetarians, you should know that your choice is a good one. In general, vegetarians are lighter in weight than non-vegetarians. If you have diabetes, it is easier to control, and if you are at risk for diabetes, you are less likely to get it if you eat vegetarian. Vegetarian eating is also associated with less cancer, strokes, and heart attacks.

You still have to make good choices in the vegetarian restaurant. Stay away from the creamy, buttery foods and enjoy the lighter dishes made with grains like quinoa. Use beans and lentils to get your protein without the accompanying fat of meat.

272 Part III: Eating Away from Home Seafood Most fish are relatively low in fat and can be a healthy choice. But even the best fish can compromise your nutrition plan when theyre fried. Fish that stand out in the lowfat category are cod, bass, halibut, swordfish, and tuna in water. Most of the shellfish varieties are also lowfat. Stay away from herring, tuna in oil, and fried anything.

Chinese food You can eat some great Chinese food and not have to worry about upsetting your diet plan. Any of the soups on the menu will be delicious and fill you up. Stick to vegetable dishes with small amounts of meat in them. Avoid fried dishes, whether theyre meats, tofu, or rice and noodles. Steamed dishes are a much better choice. Potstickers, an appetizer often found on the menu, and sweet-and-sour pork will really throw off your calorie count and your fat intake. Stay away from the almond cookies that often follow Chinese meals.

French food While the old style of preparing French food promotes a lot of cream and gravy, a new style, called the new cuisine, emphasizes the freshest ingredients, usually cooked in their own sauce. This style has revolutionized the French restaurants. Still, some French chefs cling to the old ways, and their food is not for you, unless youre prepared to share your meal.

Most desserts in French restaurants are high in carbohydrate. Limit yourself to a taste or, better yet, dont tempt yourself by ordering the cake or custard in the first place. See if the pastry chef has a fruit dish, like a poached pear, that is both delicious and good for you.

Indian food Rice and pita bread are good carbohydrate choices, but avoid foods made with coconut milk because of its fat content. Meat, fish, and poultry cooked in the tandoori manner (baked in an oven) are fine, but Indian chefs like to fry many foods; keep those to a minimum. Curries are fine as long as theyre not made with coconut milk. Avoid ghee, which is clarified butter. Fried appetizers like samosas and creamy dishes do not help your blood glucose. Chicken tikka and chapatti are fine  theyre made with delicious spices (for taste) but little fat.

Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience 273 Italian food Stick to tomato-based sauces and avoid the creamy, buttery, cheesy sauces.

Minestrone soup is a hearty vegetable soup that is low in fat. Pasta in general is fine as long as the sauce isnt fatty. The problem with the pasta, however, is that the quantity is almost always too great. Share it or take half home.

Sausage, because of all the added fats, is a poor choice, whether served with pasta or placed on pizza. Pesto sauce can be made with little fat. If you love the taste of basil, as Dr. Rubin does, ask for a lowfat version of this classic sauce. Ask whether the kitchen staff will make garlic bread with roasted garlic alone, without the butter that often accompanies it. Youll be delighted with the delicious taste. Avoid Caesar salad and dishes made with a lot of cheese, such as cheese-filled ravioli.

Mexican food Mexican food has become increasingly popular, but Mexican restaurants offer you many temptations to slip from your healthy eating plan. They often start with chips, nachos, and cheese. Tell your waiter to keep them off the table. Have salsa, not guacamole, as an appetizer. Stay away from anything refried; it means just what the word says. Avoid all dishes laden with cheese, as well as dishes heavy in sausage. Chicken with rice, grilled fish, and grilled chicken are excellent choices. Tortillas, burritos, and tostadas are delicious and good for you as long as you avoid the addition of a lot of cheese, sour cream, or guacamole. And keep in mind the importance of moderation.

Mexican restaurants are known for large servings, so take some home.

Thai food Other than the tendency to provide larger-than-needed portions, there is little that Thai restaurants do that is not good for the person with diabetes.

The creative use of spices, emphasis on fish, and use of fresh vegetables make this cuisine a good choice for you. Just watch out for the spices.

Enjoying Your Food If youve been conscientious in planning a delicious restaurant meal ahead of time, you deserve to really enjoy the food. But you need to continue thinking about healthy eating (and drinking) habits even as you sit down to the meal.

All the great planning can come undone if youre careless at this point. Think about the following advice as you eat: 274 Part III: Eating Away from Home  If you have a glass of wine, consider the number of calories.

Try using some behavior modification to prolong the meal and give your brain a chance to know that youve eaten: Eat slowly, chew each bite thoroughly, and put your fork down between each bite.

Remember that the meal is a social occasion. Spend more time talking to your companions and less time concentrating on the food.

Remove the skin if youre eating poultry, and allow the sauce to drip off the morsel of food on your fork if youre eating a dish cooked in a sauce.

After youve carefully controlled the intake of food on your plate, dont add significant calories by tasting or finishing the food on your companions plate.

Finishing with Dessert For many people, the early parts of a meal are just a prelude to their favorite part, which is dessert. Most people have a sweet tooth, and dessert is often the way that they satisfy that need. The Italians dont call the part of the menu that features the desserts the dulci (which means sweets) without reason. Dessert, in many restaurants, has become a showpiece. The pastry chef tries to show how sweet he or she can make the dessert while creating a culinary work of art. The term decadent is often used in describing the richness of these desserts.

Does this mean that you cant have any dessert at all? No. Making a wise choice simply requires a certain amount of awareness on your part. You need to ask yourself the question, Is the taste of this dessert worth the potential damage it will do to my blood glucose and calorie intake? If you can answer this question with a yes, then have the dessert, but check your blood glucose and adjust your medications as needed after eating it. Then return to your nutritional plan without spending a lot of time regretting your lapse.

You might even do a little extra exercise to counteract the calories.

On the other hand, if you want to answer the question with a no, ask yourself these questions to help you avoid temptation:  Do you really need or want the dessert?

Will you remember it ten minutes later when youre at the theater?

Could you share the dessert or just taste it?

Is a fruit dessert available that you could enjoy instead?

Chapter 17: Making Eating Out a Nourishing Experience 275 To help you avoid that high-calorie dessert even further, think in terms of the number of minutes of active aerobic exercise you must do to account for the calories you consume in a dessert. If your exercise is walking, double these times. Here are some examples:  Boston cream pie: 32 minutes  Brownie: 32 minutes  Apple pie: 34 minutes  Hot fudge sundae: 38 minutes  Cheesecake: 40 minutes  Ice cream cone: 44 minutes  Strawberry milkshake: 47 minutes You may conclude that dessert is worth your time, but well leave that decision up to you.

Heres your chance. Youre invited to travel with them on the highways and byways of some of the most scenic areas of the country with the best destinations. You will stop along the way at some of the best-known fast-food res- Enjoying Hemingway Country: taurants. Luckily, you are with Cait, who knows the contents of all the foods in these restaurants, and Dr. Rubin, who is there to make sure that you enjoy The Florida Keys 284 yourself while staying on your eating program. If you want to get the details on these trips, you can refer to Frommers very popular travel guides (published by Wiley). We give you just the bare essentials here.

Discovering Where FDR and We selected these specific restaurants because theyre usually the most common examples of a particular class of fast-food restaurants. In no way do we mean to recommend them above others in their class.

Eleanor Hung Out: Maine 286 In this chapter, we hit the high spots, the most commonly visited fast-food places. Keep in mind that one chapter isnt enough space to cover the hundreds of different fast-food franchises all over the country. In general, a burger in McDonalds looks like a burger at Burger King, but there are major variations.

278 Part III: Eating Away from Home Touring the Fast-Food Landscape Is it even important to discuss fast-food restaurants? McDonalds claims that it serves 26 million customers every day in the United States. Thats almost one in ten of all Americans. It has 13,700 restaurants, compared with 7,600 for Burger King; 5,900 for Wendys; and 3,300 for Arbys. You bet they have a huge impact on eating in America.

People used to say that at fast-food restaurants you could get more nourish-ment from biting your lip than eating the food. This is definitely no longer the case. Because everyone is conscious of good nutrition these days, you can now find something healthful to eat in any fast-food restaurant.

Watch for a few key words that warn you not to order a particular item in these restaurants. If the food is called a double, big, jumbo, monster, or the ultimate, stay away from that selection. Also avoid any menu item with bacon or sausage.

The reason these establishments are called fast-food restaurants is that they have food preparation, ordering, and serving down to the least amount of time possible. Because were in a hurry on our trips in this chapter and dont want to stop for a long time, theres nothing wrong with enjoying that convenience, but we want to make sure that the food is right for you.

Of course, some of these places arent meant to rush into and out of. They are sit-down places, but the food is standardized and is prepared pretty fast, so the result is about the same. This chapter discusses those kinds of restaurants, too.

One advantage of franchise restaurants is that a hamburger in a Dennys in California is almost exactly the same as a hamburger in a Dennys in New Mexico or Oregon. You know exactly what youre getting, which makes the meal easier to fit into your diet. On the other hand, the quick serving and eating often doesnt allow your brain enough time to recognize that your body has eaten enough calories, and you may be tempted to order more food. Dont.

A study published in The Lancet in December 2004 that followed 3,000 people over 15 years showed that those who ate regularly at fast-food restaurants gained 10 pounds more than those who did not and were much more likely to develop diabetes. They did not have Cait and Dr. Rubin along to help them as you do. Cait has selected the restaurants in advance to save you the trouble of choosing them along the way.

Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary 279 In Chapter 2, I introduce you to trans fats, the absolutely worst kind of fat, because it not only raises bad cholesterol but lowers good cholesterol. These fats are also called hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Since 2006, food labels have had to list the amount of trans fats, and the better fast-food places are trying to eliminate them from their cooking. Theyre still present in large amounts, however, especially in foods like french-fried potatoes, batter-dipped fried onions, fried mozzarella sticks, and buffalo wings. The best way to avoid trans fats is to order food that is low in all fats. The fast-food restaurants that have no trans fats in their foods include:  In-N-Out Burger  Subway  Taco Bell  Pizza Hut  Popeyes  Little Caesars  Papa Johns The fast-food restaurants that are the worst offenders with the most items with trans fats are:  Jack in the Box  Burger King  White Castle  A & W  Dairy Queen On the trips Im going to take in this chapter, Im going to avoid the heavy offenders and emphasize the zero users.

No one should say that a person with diabetes cant go to a fast-food restaurant and remain on his or her nutritional plan. But these places do offer many seductive and unhealthy choices. You need to plan in advance what youre going to choose. You cant go wrong if you stick to the selections that we talk about in this chapter.

If you want to be sure of the nutritional content of various fast foods, refer to your favorite search engine on the Internet and enter the name of a specific franchise. All the details are there.

280 Part III: Eating Away from Home Driving From New Orleans to See Civil War Plantations We start with a fairly short trip filled with old plantations that are open to the public. Plan this trip in the Spring or Fall because Summer is extremely hot here.

Figure 18-1: New Orleans to St.

Francisvil e.

After breakfast at our hotel, we leave New Orleans on I-10 going west and leave I-10 at exit 220 onto I-310. At exit 6 we find State Route 48, which takes us to the Destrehan Plantation. We spend an hour there and get back on I-310. Cait has picked out a Popeyes Restaurant a short distance away on US 90 in Boutte for lunch.

Popeyes is a popular chicken restaurant, where the chicken can be mild or spicy. Cait suggests that you have the mild chicken and recommends a wing, a leg, a thigh and a breast. It should be skinless and with no breading. That saves lots of calories. It adds up to only 200 kilocalories, most of which is 51 grams of protein with only 912 grams of fat and no carbohydrate. If you have Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary 281 it breaded and with the skin, for example the thigh goes from 80 to 280 kilocalories, while the breast goes from 120 to 350 kilocalories. Cait has really saved you from a lot of excess calories.

You can add some carbohydrate with a piece of corn on the cob. It has 37 grams of carbohydrate and 190 kilocalories. Or have some Cajun Rice at 170 kilocalories and 22 grams of carbs. Try to drink water for your beverage. Cait recommends that you skip the dessert, a cinnamon apple turnover that has 34 grams of sugars.

We continue following the River Road, which runs on either side of the Mississippi to Garyville and the San Francisco Plantation House where we spend another couple of hours. Continuing west we get to the Laura Plantation and spend time there. We find a place to stay at Vacherie, a little farther along the River Road.

We are up early the next morning heading for Donaldsonville on State Route 3089 where Cait knows there is a McDonalds for breakfast. Cait suggests an Egg McMuffin, which has 300 kilocalories with 12g of fat, 260mg of cholesterol and 30g of carbohydrate. She tells us to skip the breakfasts with sausages and bacon and warns us against the Big Breakfasts and the Deluxe Breakfasts that have almost 1,000 kilocalories or more per serving. A small glass of orange juice is 12 ounces, so we share a glass and each get 70 kilocalories that way.

Cait has her usual black coffee, which helps to explain why she remains so slim (her good diet and all the exercise she does). She avoids the lattes and the cappuccinos that bring the calories up to almost 300.

Leaving McDonalds we head on State Route 1 farther west to Nottoway Plantation, visit there, and go on to Baton Rouge where we find the Magnolia Mound Plantation, and then end the trip at St. Francisville, where we find the beautiful Rosedown Plantation.

Finding Gold and Silver in Colorado Take this trip in the summer and you can do it in a day, although its better to take your time and give it two days. We all start out in Colorado Springs, Colorado heading north on U. S. 24, stopping at the Garden of the Gods, an amazing series of geological formations. We continue to the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument, where plants, insects, and trees are preserved.

Continuing on U. S. 24, we get to Hartsel, where we take State Route 9 north.

Cait suggests we continue to Breckenridge. From Breckenridge we stay on 9 282 Part III: Eating Away from Home for 10 miles where it joins I-70, getting off in Dillon, where we will have lunch.

Its a total of 120 miles from Colorado Springs.

She has picked out Arbys in Dillon. She wanted to try Ruby Tuesdays but the nutritional information is so sparse that she did not know what to recommend. Arbys has its problems as well. Many of its items have trans fats and are high in salt. She suggests we have the Chopped Turkey Club Salad.

It is only 230 kilocalories, of which 95 come from 11g of fat. The sodium is a little high at 801mg. The Chopped Farmhouse Chicken-Grilled is an alternate choice with less sodium. Both dishes have 9g of carbohydrate. Cait tells us not to add Dijon Honey Mustard Dressing, which adds 180 kilocalories, almost all from fat. The Toasted Subs are loaded with salt and calories and are not a good choice, similar to the Market Fresh Sandwiches. For example, the Ultimate BLT Sandwich is 779 kilocalories with 45g of fat and 1,571mg of sodium.

Figure 18-2: Colorado Springs to Brecken- ridge in a large circle.

Returning to I-70, we head to Georgetown, a center for the mining of both silver and gold. There is plenty to see in Georgetown about mining and we visit the Hamill House Museum.

Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary 283 After Georgetown, we continue back on I-70 heading east. It joins up with US 40 right into Golden, Colorado, where the Coors Brewing Company is located and can be visited. There are plenty of nice local restaurants in Golden, so we eat at one and stay in Golden for the night. The next day we will pick up US 6 and follow it through Denver to where it joins with I-25 and then go south for a visit to the Air Force Academy at exit 156B.

We head back to Colorado Springs on I-25. Cait wanted to stop at PF Changs in Colorado Springs for lunch but the items contain so much salt and do not list trans fats, so she vetoes this idea. Instead she takes us off exit 150 to a nearby Taco Bell. She suggests any of the tacos, gorditas, or chalupas, but not the burritos, which are too salty. The recommended items generally have about 300 kilocalories, 600mg of sodium, 12 to 18g of fat, and 30g of carbohydrate. They are very tasty, and we enjoy our lunch before departing.

Visiting Utahs Major Attractions We have decided to take a shorter trip of 82 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah to Mirror Lake. We head east on I-80 early in the morning towards Park City, getting off at exit 141 where Cait knows there is a Starbucks.

At Starbucks you can drink a lot of calories if you order a fancy coffee like a Double Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino Blended Crme-whip at 510 kilocalories. If you order a cup of todays blend, its 5 kilocalories. Unfortunately, Starbucks does not give you nutritional information for their cakes and pastries, but half a bagel toasted will be just fine. A little jam on it wont hurt a bit, either.

It sets you back just 100 kilocalories. Of course, if you add things like cream cheese, all bets are off.

Getting back in our car, we head to Park City. We have dinner and breakfast in our hotel. The next morning we get on the road early. We are headed to Wasatch-Cache National Forest on Route 248, then up to the Upper Provo River Falls on Route 150 to Washington Lake, a beautiful spot. We pass through Bald Mountain Pass and stop for more scenery at Mirror Lake. Then we retrace our route back to Salt Lake City, getting off I-80 at exit 126 where Cait has selected a Wendys.

Wendys offers many good choices for the traveler with diabetes. The Mandarin Chicken Salad has only 180 kilocalories, only 2g of fat, and 16g of carbohydrate. Its mostly protein (24g). The Chicken Caesar is about the same. Watch out for the chili  too much salt. Stay away from the shakes and the Frostys  too many calories. Avoid the Baconator with 830 kilocalories 284 Part III: Eating Away from Home and 1,880g of sodium. If you must have meat, the 14-lb Hamburger Patty is not a bad selection. But dont have any doubles or triples. And try not to add cheese to your hamburger. It quickly raises the calorie and salt count.

After lunch we visit Temple Square in Salt Lake City, the center of Mormonism.

Figure 18-3: Salt Lake City to Mirror Lake.

Enjoying Hemingway Country: The Florida Keys We are back in the southeastern United States, taking a wonderful ride from Key Largo to Key West, where Hemingway made his home. There is water on either side of the road and plenty of beautiful beaches to stop at. The distance is 106 miles, but we will take three days, since we want to do plenty of swimming and other water sports. The entire trip is on US 1. We begin in Florida City and head south.

We stop in Key Largo for some snorkeling and then have lunch. Cait has already selected a Subway Restaurant right along US 1 in Key Largo. She has checked the nutritional information, which is pretty complete. Subway very nicely lists their food by grams of fat. In the 6-grams-of-fat or less column, Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary 285 there are plenty of sandwiches to choose from. The only problem is that they all have a fair amount of sodium.

Cait suggests we share a sandwich, and you suggest we buy two sandwiches and cut them in three pieces, then each have two of the pieces. Great idea!

That reduces both the calories and the salt by 13. But we cant get the foot-long sandwiches, which just have too much salt, even if we share them. You like the 6-inch Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki, and Cait likes the 6-inch Veggie Delite. I like everything. Not bad at all and no trans fats. The total we each end up with is about 200 kilocalories with 33g of carbohydrate, 17g of protein, and 3g of fat.

We continue to Tavernier, where we stop at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center and then go on to Lignumvitae Key Botanical State Park, to which we take a boat. Finally we arrive in Long Key, where we are staying, and have dinner at the hotel.

The following morning we do some snorkeling and then head to Grassy Key in the city of Marathon, where we visit the Dolphin Research Center. We are all hungry for some breakfast, so Cait suggests the IHOP along US 1 in Marathon.

Cait suggests either a couple of buttermilk pancakes, a couple of harvest grain n nut pancakes, a couple of buckwheat pancakes, or a waffle. Each of these contains about 225 kilocalories with 6g of fat and 34g of carbohydrate.

Of course, we have to have some pancake syrup but go very light on this.

Still, it adds another 115 kilocalories from 29g of carbohydrate. Four ounces of orange juice adds an additional 15g of carbohydrate. I drink tea, but you and Cait have your morning coffee.

We continue to Bahia Honda Key and the Bahia Honda State Park for some hiking. We follow the road a few more miles to Big Pine Key, where we are staying, and have dinner and breakfast in our hotel.

Next morning we continue to Key West, where we visit the Hemingway Home and Museum and the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum, which houses a fascinating collection of artifacts from the sunken Spanish galleon, Atocha. Then its off to Mallory Square to celebrate the sunset.

286 Part III: Eating Away from Home Figure 18-4: Key Largo to Key West.

Discovering Where FDR and Eleanor Hung Out: Maine Franklin Delano Roosevelt, our 32nd president, loved to stay at Campobello Island in Maine. You, Cait, and I begin this trip on US 1 in West Gouldsboro, Maine about 1,800 miles from the same US 1 we just took to Key West. The distance is 100 miles, but there are lots of detours and plenty of things to do, so we will stay one night along the way.

We head out on US 1 to Columbia Falls, where we visit the Ruggles House, an old mansion with plenty of interesting architecture. North of Columbia Falls we take Route 187 to Jonesport and visit Great Wass Island for hiking, ocean views, and wildlife. Route 187 takes us back to US 1 and on to Machias.

We find the Dunkin Donuts that Cait has discovered. Of course, we are going to bypass the 500 kilocalorie cookies, the 620 kilocalorie Coffee Cake Muffin, and the 300 to 500-plus kilocalorie donuts. What self-control! Instead we are each having one of the Oven Roasted Flatbread Sandwiches that does not Chapter 18: Fast Food on Your Itinerary 287 contain cheese, like the Southwest Chicken, the Egg White Veggie, or the Egg White Turkey at around 300 kilocalories, 9g of fat, and 38g of carbohydrate.

When we finish, Cait tells us we have followed the program so well that we can share any donut three ways. What a treat!

We stay overnight in Machias and leave on Route 191 for some driving along the coast, rejoining US 1 after a while. Not far away is Quoddy Head State Park, which happens to be the easternmost point in the country. After some viewing and hiking, we head back to Route 189 to Lubec. Lubec has no fast-food restaurants, according to Cait, so we splurge at Murphys Village Restaurant, where the food is good, the service is good, and the people are friendly. Sorry, I wont tell you what we had there!

We cross the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial Bridge over to Campobello. We stop at the Visitor Center, and then we visit the Roosevelt Cottage. The so-called Cottage is 34 rooms and there is plenty of FDR history to be seen.

None of them cost anything other than time. Doing throughout the Day 295 them one at a time makes a big difference in your calorie and fat intake.

Adding one after another makes the results huge. Your weight, blood pressure, and blood glucose all fall. Who could ask for anything more?

Reducing Added Fat 296 Maintaining a Food Diary Removing the Attached Fat 296 Try this little diversion: For the next two days, write down everything you eat and drink. Before you go to bed on the evening of the second day, take a separate piece of paper and try to reconstruct what you have eaten for the past two days without looking at your original list. Then compare the two Leaving Out the Salt 297 lists. The differences in the lists will startle you. The point of this exercise is to show you that youre doing a lot of mindless eating. Trying to follow a nutritional plan from memory doesnt work.

Adding Taste with Condiments, Herbs, and Spices 297 Cooking by the Bs 298 292 Part IV: The Part of Tens A food diary not only shows you what youre eating all the time but also makes it easy to select items to reduce in portion size or eliminate altogether.

When you go to your doctor, the fact that your diary lists birdseed for every meal helps confirm your statement that you eat like a bird.

You might even want to include something in your diary about how youre feeling and what youre doing. This information, besides turning your diary into a more personal statement, allows you to see the associations between your mood and your food. Keeping your exercise record in the diary makes it even more useful, reminding you of when you did (or did not) exercise.

Finally, your dietitian can easily plug your food intake into a computer program to analyze such valuable information as calorie breakdown, amount of salt, levels of saturated fat, and amount of cholesterol.

Figuring Out Why You Eat the Way You Do You may recognize that you do a lot of your eating for emotional reasons. Try to remember how you ate in your family as you were growing up. What did eating mean to you and your family? Was it a way of connecting with others in the family, or was it used in some other way? Does eating trigger feelings that you want to have again and that make you feel happy or good in some other way? Or do you associate eating with negative emotions? Do you eat the way you do out of loneliness, boredom, depression, happiness, or anger; as a reward; or as a way to save time? You may come up with several reasons, but you need to understand them and begin to respond to those triggers with other actions besides eating.

After you begin to clarify the emotional aspect of your eating, you can look for ways to have the same emotions without the eating part of it. What are other things you can do to feel happy or connected? Do you eat out of boredom? What can you do to keep yourself from being bored?

This sounds like psychology, and it is. You may have to seek the help of a psychologist to find out exactly what eating means to you. Meanwhile, because that type of counseling is often a long process, try doing the other things recommended in this chapter to gain control of your eating.

All habits, including eating habits, come from repetition. Every time you do something the same way, it encourages you to do it the same way the next time. By breaking the chain, you can make healthful changes. Here are some things you can do right now until you figure out why you eat: Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits 293  Never eat and do something else at the same time, such as watch TV.

Eat in only one place in your home, preferably at the table, your designated eating place.

Eat on smaller plates.

Never eat from the bag, the container, or the carton.

Chew your food slowly and pick up all food with utensils, not fingers, after youve swallowed the previous bite.

Always leave food on your plate to develop the habit of stopping eating when youre full.

Keep food only in the kitchen and out of sight, not on counters.

Avoid junk food that has no nutritional value but only calories.

Eat three meals and even a couple of healthy snacks every day.

Select a healthy alternative to eating, such as exercise, a creative hobby, or even conversations with your spouse.

Choose non-food rewards, such as new clothes for your new shape.

Perform one of these actions at a time. When youve made that action a part of your behavior, try a second action. Build up to many changes. Youll be delighted with the results.

Eating Every Meal When you miss meals, you become hungry. If you have type 1 diabetes, you cant safely miss meals, especially if you give yourself regular or lispro insulin. Instead of letting yourself become hungry, eat your meals at regular times so that you dont overcompensate at the next meal (or at a snack shortly after the meal you missed) when youre suffering from low blood glucose.

Many people overtreat low blood glucose by eating too many sugar calories, resulting in high blood glucose later on.

You should not miss meals as a weight-loss method, particularly if you take a drug that lowers blood glucose into hypoglycemic levels. A pregnant woman with diabetes especially should not miss meals. She must make up for the fact that her baby extracts large amounts of glucose from her blood. Both mother and growing fetus are adversely affected if the mothers body must turn to stored fat for energy.

294 Part IV: The Part of Tens Eating smaller meals and having snacks in between is probably the best way to eat because doing so raises blood glucose the least, provides a constant source of energy, and allows control of the blood glucose using the least amount of external or internal insulin.

The fact is, following your complete nutritional plan in fewer than three meals is extremely difficult.

Sitting Down for Meals Eating food with others is one of the pleasures of life. As an added advantage, it also slows the pace of your eating, which allows your brain to recognize when youre full so you stop eating at the appropriate time. By sitting down and eating more slowly, you slow the absorption of carbohydrates, thus slow-ing the rise in your blood glucose.

Another advantage of sitting down and eating with others is that they serve as a brake on how much you eat. When people eat alone, they tend to eat more. In the company of others, youre restrained by social controls. By eating while sitting at the table, you see only the food on the table. When you stand and eat, you can easily walk to the kitchen, where all the rest of the food is (if youre not there already).

You usually limit the food served at the table to what is on your plate, so you arent exposed to excessive food. You can make sure that the only foods brought to the table are acceptable food choices, especially if theyre prepared as attractively as possible. A lot of your eating is done because the food looks so good, so make the right foods the best-looking foods.

Drinking Water throughout the Day Seventy percent of your body is water, and all your many organs and cells require water to function properly. Most people, especially older people, dont get enough water. Older people often have the additional disadvantage of losing their ability to sense when theyre thirsty. The consequences may include weakness and fatigue, not to mention constipation.

Water can replace all the sodas and juice drinks that add unwanted calories to your day. You soon lose your taste for those drinks and discover that you dont need (or miss) the aftertaste of soda and juice that you took for granted. Those drinks also raise the blood glucose very rapidly and are often used to treat low blood glucose.

Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits 295 One of our patients admitted to drinking 10 to 12 cans of cola drinks daily.

He had a high blood glucose that returned to normal when he broke his cola habit.

Make drinking water a part of your daily habits. Drink some when you brush your teeth. Drink more with meals and snacks. Many people dont want to drink much water close to bedtime because if they do, theyll have to get up during the night to go to the bathroom  all the more reason to make sure you get your daily water ration, which should be at least eight 8-ounce glasses, early in the day.

Consuming Vegetables throughout the Day What makes you think that you can use broccoli only as a side dish with your dinner meat or fish? How can you possibly get in your daily three to five servings of vegetables if you think like this? What would happen if you drank vegetable juice for breakfast? Suppose you added vegetables to an omelet?

How about a salad at lunch instead of that large sandwich containing way too much carbohydrate?

You can find so many different kinds of vegetables in the grocery, yet most people limit themselves to very few of them. Your whole meal can consist of vegetables with a small amount of protein thrown in just as a garnish. Try a vegetarian restaurant to see for yourself how delicious freshly prepared vegetables can be.

Were not talking about the starchy vegetables, such as beans, peas, and lentils that really belong in the starch list of exchanges, but rather the vegetables that contain much less carbohydrate. These vegetables include asparagus, bok choy, green beans, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, collards, onions, summer squash, turnips, and water chestnuts.

Use these vegetables in meals and for snacks. They fill you up but add very few calories. Some are just as good when frozen and defrosted (because they are flash frozen immediately after picking) as they are when fresh. Especially good snack vegetables include baby carrots, cucumbers, and pieces of sweet pepper.

296 Part IV: The Part of Tens Reducing Added Fat If you use recipes that have been handed down in your family, they often contain much unnecessary added fat. The same can be said for recipes created by chefs who arent conscious of the harmful effects of high fat intake. We carefully selected the recipes in this book to minimize added fat. You should try to do the same thing when you cook.

Cooking food doesnt generally require the extra fat. We can remember when a pancake recipe required a cup of vegetable oil, but we now know that you can make delicious pancakes without all that oil. Although vegetable oil is better for you than animal fats like lard and butter, it still has plenty of calories  in fact, as many as animal fats. A gram of fat contains 9 kilocalories, no matter the source.

Try reducing the suggested fat by 50 percent. See whether the taste suffers or if preparing the food is more difficult.

How much difference does reducing the fat make in terms of kilocalories? A cup of oil is 8 ounces, and each ounce is 28.35 grams. Because each gram has 9 kilocalories, a cup of oil contains about 2,000 kilocalories. You get rid of 1,000 kcalories by reducing the fat in half. If your recipe serves four people, each person is getting 250 kilocalories less fat. Is that a worthwhile reduction?

You bet!

Chapter 20 is full of great substitutions.

Removing the Attached Fat Many foods, such as sausage and luncheon meats, contain so much fat that lowering their fat content isnt possible. You should mostly avoid these foods. But other protein sources, such as chicken, steak, roast beef, and pork, have large amounts of visible fat attached to them, so you can remove this fat before you prepare the food. In the case of poultry, removing the skin removes most of the fat. Selecting white meat rather than dark further reduces the fat in poultry.

As fat cooks on a grill, it often flames, which causes the meat to burn.

Removing the fat before you cook it makes the cooking process safer (because the burning fat wont spray around), and the resulting meat is much lower in calories.

Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Simple Steps to Change Your Eating Habits 297 Leaving Out the Salt For reasons that are unclear to us, most Americans like a lot of salt in their food. Consequently, these people taste mostly salt and not much of the food.

Try getting rid of the salt in your recipes. You can always add it later if you miss the flavor that salt adds. At first, you may think that the food tastes bland. Then youll begin to discover the subtle tastes that were in the food all along but were overpowered by the salt.

Why do we emphasize cutting salt levels? We know that salt raises blood pressure. Recent studies, particularly the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, which was a major breakthrough published in 1998, have shown that you can slow or prevent diabetic complications by reducing blood pressure.

You can try the approach of slowly removing salt from the recipe. If it calls for a teaspoon of salt, add only 34 teaspoon. You wont notice the difference. Next time, try 12 teaspoon. And so on. In the recipes in this book, we have tried to use less salt wherever possible, with the permission of the chefs who created the recipes. Most chefs have been very open to eliminating salt.

Adding Taste with Condiments, Herbs, and Spices This section explores a case of getting something for almost nothing. If you like a lot of distinctive flavors in your food, try using various condiments, herbs, and spices to replace the flavors of fat and salt. Experimenting with these flavors can bring entirely new tastes to old favorite recipes. Surely, the new millennium is all about breaking free from old habits of eating, which may not be so good for you, and replacing them with new tastes.

Many of the chefs in this book  who are some of the most renowned chefs in the world  have achieved their fame by virtue of their willingness to go in new taste directions. They have combined foods that no one put together before and used spices not traditionally used in foods from their particular ethnic origin. The result has been an explosion of new tastes combined with better nutrition.

Foods that you associate with bland taste, such as some fish, come alive when you add the right herbs and spices. You may never have liked those foods before, but you will now. Not only do they taste different, but they smell wonderful and exotic. They have the additional advantage of being very good for you.

298 Part IV: The Part of Tens Examples of condiments that add great taste and few calories are salsa, hot sauce, mustard, and horseradish. Herbs that add flavor include rosemary, thyme, and basil. They are best added toward the end of cooking to preserve their flavor if fresh, or at the beginning of cooking to bring out their flavor if dried.

Cooking by the Bs The best methods of cooking all begin with a b, such as braising, broiling, boiling, and barbecuing. These methods of preparation dont add fat and often remove a lot of the fat within the food. Broiling a hamburger, for example, often eliminates as much fat from a moderate-fat hamburger as buying a reduced-fat hamburger to begin with. Frying, sauting, and other methods that depend on butter or fat add exactly the things that you want to remove.

If you must use fat, use a cooking spray that reduces the amount of added fat.

Contents Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions 299 Chapter 20 Using Several Foods for Animal Protein 299 Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions Spilling the Beans 300 In This Chapter  Replacing meat Avoiding Meat and Chicken Stock 300  Substituting for milk  Enjoying cheese in another form Replacing Cheeses 301 You will be surprised at how easy it is to eliminate meat and dairy and substitute with something just as delicious. Sometimes the food will taste different, so you have to try different vegetable products to see what Avoiding Cows Milk 301 works best. You may even find that the taste of the food when vegetable sources are used is better than when animal sources are used. It takes getting used to, but the advantages for your health are worth the effort.

Choosing to Replace Milk Chocolate 302 Take a good look at the vegetarian recipes in this book. They show you that vegetarian cooking is just as complex and interesting as cooking with meat, fish, or poultry. If you try several of them, as Cait and Dr. Rubin did, you will find that they are just as delicious as the non-vegetarian recipes.

Avoiding Mayonnaise 302 Using Several Foods for Animal Protein Banishing Eggs 303 There are a number of vegetarian foods that can take the place of meat, depending on what you feel like eating. Baked portobello mushrooms can taste amazingly close to a steak with the same texture and juiciness. Tofu can replace chicken in lots of dishes, especially stir-fried food.

Avoiding Sour Cream 303 Textured vegetable protein (TVP) is made from soy. It comes in small dry chunks that resemble dried vegetables. It cooks quickly, supplying vegetable protein without fat. You can use TVP to replace meat in soups and stews. It is Enjoying Non-Dairy Ice Cream 304 available in large supermarkets and natural food stores.

300 Part IV: The Part of Tens Eggplant and mushrooms are other vegetables that replace meat with ease, especially in the southern United States. Eggplant can be stuffed, roasted, marinated, grilled, even fried (not recommended). Combine it with tomato and onions and you have ratatouille.

Spilling the Beans You know that your muscles are made of protein, so naturally when you think of protein, you think of meat. The time has come to recognize that protein comes from many sources, however. Vegetables have proteins, too, and they dont have the fat that meats provide.

People have suggested that you cant eat only vegetable protein sources because they lack some of the building blocks required for muscle growth, and that you can find those building blocks only in animal protein. As always, an exception breaks that rule: the soybean. Soybeans contain all the different building blocks you need to build your own protein.

Even without soybeans, you can get all the building blocks you need by eating several different vegetable protein sources together, such as rice and beans or yogurt with chopped nuts.

The best nonmeat sources of protein are legumes like dried beans and peas.

Other protein sources include nuts and seeds, but they contain quite a bit of fat, so the calorie count swells. The following vegetable protein sources provide the equivalent of an ounce of animal protein:  14 cup of seeds (like sunflower seeds)  13 cup of nuts (like pecans and peanuts)  12 cup of cooked dry beans  12 cup of baked beans  12 cup of tofu Avoiding Meat and Chicken Stock Soup recipes need a stock usually, and most of them call for meat or chicken stock. Vegetable stock will fill the bill very well, though you will get a change in taste. Youll also probably get much less salt. But vegetable stock is not the only thing you can use. Garlic broth can be made to do the job. The ingredients for 8 cups of garlic broth are: Chapter 20: Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions 301  3 small heads of garlic, smashed and peeled  1 tablespoon of olive oil  Coarse salt to taste  Freshly ground pepper to taste  9 cups of water You can also use water or wine with 1 to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce per cup of liquid. There is no need to use meat or chicken stock again.

Replacing Cheeses If you want to go the vegan way and avoid dairy, there are lots of ways to replace the cheeses that you commonly use in recipes. Here are some suggestions:  There are vegan cheeses available in supermarkets that taste just like cheddar cheese, mozzarella, and Monterey jack.

Crumbled tofu can take the place of cottage cheese and ricotta cheese.

Tofu cream cheese can replace regular cream cheese.

They can be used on pizzas, in sauces, and anything that requires melting cheese.

Avoiding Cows Milk This is an easy one. Soy milk is an excellent replacement for cows milk. It is made by cleaning and soaking soy beans overnight, then pureing them. The solids are strained out, and the liquid is boiled for ten minutes. You can buy soy milk right next to cows milk in the market. Some of the benefits include:  It has more protein and fiber than cows milk.

It has isoflavones, chemicals that are thought to prevent cancers, heart disease, and osteoporosis.

It has about 2 percent fat but no cholesterol.

Older women can use soy milk to reduce menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes.

302 Part IV: The Part of Tens Soy milk does not have calcium like cows milk so you will need to get your calcium elsewhere. Almonds, beans, and green leafy vegetables are good sources.

Choosing to Replace Milk Chocolate Dark chocolate has flavonols, which are antioxidants that may be protective against cancer, but milk chocolate does not have the same benefits because the proteins in the milk bind the flavonols so they are unavailable. Chocolate also has caffeine. Since cocoa, the basis for chocolate, is naturally bitter, high fructose corn syrup and refined sugar as well as fats are added to sweeten it.

Carob is a naturally sweet, caffeine-free substitute. It comes from the fruit pods of carob trees found in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The beans are dried, roasted, and ground to make carob powder. Carob powder is high in fiber, unlike chocolate. But dont think that carob is for dieting.

When it is used to make candies and so forth, it can contain just as many calories as chocolate.

Avoiding Mayonnaise A tablespoon of mayonnaise has 49 kilocalories, most of which is fat, though not necessarily the bad saturated fat. People tend to put a lot of mayonnaise on sandwiches, adding 49 kilocalories for each tablespoon, so it doesnt take long to add a lot of calories just from this condiment.

Instead of standard mayonnaise, try tofu mayonnaise:  1 clove garlic  8 ounces tofu, drained  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  1 tablespoon olive oil  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  Sea salt Blend together for 25 seconds until smooth. Makes 1 cup.

Now you can enjoy the taste of mayonnaise with far fewer calories.

Chapter 20: Ten Easy Vegetarian Substitutions 303 Banishing Eggs There are plenty of substitutes for eggs. The substitutes dont have the fat found in the standard mayonnaise, but they can be used for baking. You cant use the substitutes, however, for replacing more than 2 eggs in a recipe. It wont work. Here are some substitutes you can use for 1 egg:  112 teaspoons commercial powdered egg replacer  1 mashed small ripe banana  14 cup blended soft tofu  1 cup unsweetened applesauce  14 cup pureed prunes You want to experiment a little and see how the substitute tastes compared with an egg. It may even be better in many recipes.

Avoiding Sour Cream Sour cream is only mildly sour but it is full of fats. It contains 14 grams of butterfat in a 4-ounce serving. Thats saturated fat (bad fat) we are talking about. If you are trying to stay vegetarian, you cant use yogurt, which would make a low fat substitute. But you can use tofu sour cream. Heres a fat free recipe that makes delicious tofu sour cream:  10.5-ounce package of light firm tofu  4 teaspoons lemon juice  2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar  1 teaspoon sweetener  12 teaspoon salt Process in a blender until creamy and smooth. Youll get all the taste without the fat.

304 Part IV: The Part of Tens Enjoying Non-Dairy Ice Cream Wouldnt you know, the food merchants have given us all kinds of choices for people who want ice cream without dairy. Some of the choices include:  Gelato  Sorbet  Dairy-free ice cream sandwiches  Fudge popsicles The best are soy-based. There are also plenty of recipes to be found on the Internet for making your own. Just put vegetarian ice cream in the search box of your favorite Web browser. Or pick up a book called The Vegan Scoop: 150 Recipes for Dairy-Free Ice Cream by Wheeler del Torro.

Chapter 21 Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose In This Chapter  Knowing your blood glucose level  Exercising and taking medications to stay in control  Reacting immediately to foot and dental problems  Keeping a positive attitude while planning for unexpected situations  Staying aware of new developments and using expert help  Avoiding methods that dont work In Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition, we describe the management of diabetes in detail. In this chapter, you find the highlights of that extensive discussion. Although this book is about eating, controlling your blood glucose requires much more from you. Everything we suggest is directed toward normalizing your blood glucose.

Doctors consider your blood glucose normal when its less than 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L) if youve eaten nothing for 8 to 12 hours. If youve eaten, your blood glucose is normal if its less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L) two hours after eating. If you never see a blood glucose level higher than 140, youre doing very well, indeed. See Chapter 1 for a full explanation of mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter) and mmol/L (millimoles per liter).

You can use many tricks to achieve this level of control. In this chapter, you find the best of the lot. All of our patients can remember receiving and using some advice that made a huge difference in their lives with diabetes. If you have a tip that you want to share, please send an e-mail to drrubin@ drrubin.com. Well try to get it into the next edition of this book.

306 Part IV: The Part of Tens Knowing Your Blood Glucose No excuse is adequate for you to not know your blood glucose at all times, although weve heard some pretty far-out excuses over the years  close to The dog ate my glucose meter. The ability to measure blood glucose accurately and rapidly is the greatest advance in diabetes care since the discovery of insulin. Yet many people dont track their blood glucose.

Sure, sticking your finger hurts, but laser devices now make it painless, and even the needles are so fine that you barely feel them. How can you know what to do about your blood glucose if you dont know what it is in the first place?

The number of glucose meters you can choose is vast, and theyre all good.

Your insurance company may prefer one type of meter, or your doctor may have computer hardware and software for only one type. Other than those limitations, the choice is yours.

If you have very stable blood glucose levels, test once a day  some days in the morning before breakfast, other days in the evening before supper.

Varying the time of day you test your blood glucose gives you and your doctor a clearer picture of your control under different circumstances. If your diabetes requires insulin or is unstable, you need to test at least before meals and at bedtime in order to select your insulin dose.

Painless devices for measuring blood glucose are right around the corner.

The closeness of this great advance is a particularly good reason to keep aware of new developments (see Becoming Aware of New Developments later in this chapter about tracking advancements).

Using Exercise to Control Your Glucose When people are asked how much exercise they do, about a third say that they do nothing at all. If youre a person with diabetes and consider yourself a part of that group that doesnt exercise, then you arent taking advantage of a major tool  not just for controlling your blood glucose but also for improving your physical and mental state in general. When a large group of people who were expected to develop diabetes because both parents had diabetes participated in a regular exercise program in one recent study, 80 percent who stayed on the program didnt develop diabetes.

Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose 307 Dont think that exercise means hours of exhaustion followed by a period of recovery. Were talking about a brisk walk, lasting no more than 60 minutes, every day and not necessarily all at once. If you want to do more, thats fine, but just about anyone can do this much. People who cant walk for some reason can get their exercise by moving their arms. To lose weight as a result of exercise, you need to do 90 minutes a day, every day.

Exercise can provide several benefits to your overall health. Exercise does the following:  Lowers the blood glucose by using it for energy  Helps with weight loss  Lowers bad cholesterol and triglyceride fats and raises good cholesterol  Lowers blood pressure  Reduces stress levels  Reduces the need for drugs and insulin shots When we see a new person with diabetes, we give him or her a bottle of pills.

These pills arent to be taken by mouth; theyre to be spilled on the floor and picked up every day. Its our way of making sure that a new patient gets at least a little exercise every day.

Taking Your Medications You have the advantage of having some of the best drugs for diabetes available to you, which wasnt true as recently as ten years ago. A few years ago, as specialists in diabetes, we struggled to keep our patients in good control to avoid complications of diabetes. Now, with the right combination of medications (and by using some of the other tools in this chapter), just about any patient can achieve excellent control. But no medication works if you dont take it.

The word compliance applies here. Compliance refers to the willingness of people to follow instructions  specifically, taking their medications. People tend to be very compliant at the beginning of treatment, but as they improve, compliance falls off. Diabetic control falls off along with it.

The fact is, as you get older, the forces that contribute to a worsening of your blood glucose tend to get stronger. You want to do all you can to reverse that tendency. Taking your medications is an essential part of your overall program.

308 Part IV: The Part of Tens If youre confused by all the medications you take, get yourself a medication box that holds each days medications in separate compartments so you make sure the compartment for each day is empty by the next day. Any doctor who prescribes more than two medicines to you should be able to get one for you, and you can definitely get them in drugstores.

Seeking Immediate Help for Foot Problems One error that leads to a lot of grief in diabetes is failure to seek immediate help for any foot problems. Your doctor may see you and examine your feet only once in two or three months. You need to look at your feet every day. At the first sign of any skin breakdown or other abnormality (such as discoloration), you must see your doctor. In diabetes, foot problems can go from minor to major in a very brief time. We dont pull punches in this area, because seeing your doctor is so important  major problems may mean amputation of toes or more. (See Chapter 1 for more information about foot problems as they relate to diabetes.) You can reverse most foot problems, if you catch and treat them early. You may require a different shoe or need to keep weight off the foot for a time  minor inconveniences compared to an amputation.

Besides inspecting your feet daily, here are some other actions you can take:  Testing bath water with your hands to check its temperature, because numb feet cant sense if the water is scalding hot  Ensuring that nothing is inside your shoe before you put it on  Wearing new shoes only a short time before checking for damage Taking immediate action goes for any infection you develop as a diabetic.

Infections raise the blood glucose while youre sick. Try to avoid taking steroids for anything if you possibly can. Steroids really make the glucose shoot up.

Brushing Off Dental Problems Keeping your teeth in excellent condition is important, but especially if you have diabetes. Excellent condition means brushing them twice a day and using dental floss at the end of the day to reach where the toothbrush never goes. It also means visits to the dentist on a regular basis for cleaning and examination.

Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose 309 We have seen many people with diabetes have dental problems as a result of poor dental hygiene. As a side effect, controlling the blood glucose is much harder. After patients cure their teeth, they require much less medication.

People with diabetes dont have more cavities than non-diabetics, but they do have more gum disease if their glucose isnt under control. Gum disease results from the high glucose that bathes the mouth  a perfect medium for bacteria.

Keeping your glucose under control helps you avoid losing teeth as a result of gum disease, as well as the further deterioration in glucose control.

Maintaining a Positive Attitude Your mental approach to your diabetes plays a major role in determining your success in controlling the disease. Think of diabetes as a challenge  like high school math or asking out your first date. As you overcome challenges in one area of your life, the skills you master help you in other areas.

Looking at something as a challenge allows you to use all your creativity.

When you approach something with pessimism and negativity, you tend to not see all the possible ways you can succeed. You may take the attitude that It doesnt matter what I do. That attitude leads to failure to take medications, failure to eat properly, failure to exercise, and so forth.

Simply understanding the workings of your body, which comes with treating your diabetes, probably makes you healthier than the couch potato who understands little more than the most recent sitcom.

Some people do get depressed when they find out they have diabetes. If youre depressed and your depression isnt improving after several weeks, consider seeking professional help.

Planning for the Unexpected Life is full of surprises  like when you were told you have diabetes. You probably werent ready to hear that news. But you can make yourself ready to deal with surprises that may damage your glucose control.

Most of those surprises have to do with food. You may be offered the wrong kind of food, too much food, or too little food, or the timing of food doesnt correspond to the requirements of your medication. You need to have plans for all these situations before they occur.

310 Part IV: The Part of Tens You can always reduce your portions when the food is the wrong kind or excessive, and you can carry portable calories (like glucose tablets) when food is insufficient or delayed.

Other surprises have to do with your medication, like leaving it in your luggage  which is on its way to Europe while youre headed to Hawaii.

Keep your important medications with you in your carry-on luggage, not in checked luggage. Again, your ability to think ahead can prevent you from ever being separated from your medication.

Not everything is going to go right all the time. However, you can minimize the damage by planning ahead.

Becoming Aware of New Developments The pace of new discoveries in diabetes is so rapid that keeping on top of the field is difficult even for us, the experts. How much more difficult must it be for you? You dont have access to all the publications, the drug company representatives, and the medical journals that we see every day.

However, you can keep current in a number of ways. The following tips can help you stay up-to-date on all the advances:  Begin by taking a course in diabetes from a certified diabetes educator.

Such a course gives you a basis for a future understanding of advances in diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) provides the names of certified diabetes educators.

Get a copy of Dr. Rubins book Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), which explains every aspect of diabetes for the nonprofessional.

Join a diabetes organization, particularly the American Diabetes Association. Youll start to receive the associations excellent publication, Diabetes Forecast, in the mail, which often contains the cutting edge of diabetes research as well as available treatments.

Go to Dr. Rubins Web site (www.drrubin.com) where you can find linkable addresses for the best and latest information about diabetes on the Net.

Finally, dont hesitate to question your doctor or ask to see a diabetes specialist if your doctors answers dont satisfy you.

The cure for diabetes may be in next weeks newspaper. Give yourself every opportunity to find and understand it.

Chapter 21: Ten Strategies to Normalize Your Blood Glucose 311 Utilizing the Experts The available knowledge about diabetes is huge and growing rapidly.

Fortunately, you can turn to multiple people for help. Take advantage of them all at one time or another, including the following people:  Your primary physician, who takes care of diabetes and all your other medical concerns  A diabetes specialist, who is aware of the latest and greatest in diabetes treatment  An eye doctor, who must examine you at least once a year  A foot doctor, to trim your toenails and treat foot problems  A dietitian, to help you plan your nutritional program  A diabetes educator, to teach you a basic understanding of this disease  A pharmacist, who can help you understand your medications  A mental health worker, if you run into adjustment problems Take advantage of any or all of these people when you need them. Most insurance companies are enlightened enough to pay for them if you use them.

Avoiding What Doesnt Work Not wasting your time and money on worthless treatments is important.

When you consider the almost 20 million people with diabetes in the United States alone, they provide a huge potential market for people with the latest wonder cure for diabetes. Before you waste your money, check out the claims of these crooks with your diabetes experts.

You can find plenty of treatments for diabetes on the Internet. One way you can be sure that the claims are based on science is to look for verification from the Health on the Net Foundation, which you can find at www.hon.ch/ HomePage/Home-Page.html. Its stamp of approval means the site adheres to principles that every legitimate scientist agrees with.

Dont make any substantial changes in your diabetes management without first discussing them with your physician.

They love to follow our example.

Fruit is no problem. Try taking a bowl of sweet strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries away from a small child! Its not quite as dangerous as taking a bone from a dog, but close. Most children have a natural love for sweet.

There is nothing like a sweet peach or nectarine to excite a child. Just try to get ripe fruit, not the too-early-picked, hard-as-a-rock, tart stuff that passes for fruit in many markets.

There are numerous things you can do to encourage your child to eat vegetables. In this chapter, I will provide just ten. I am sure you can come up with a few others.

One thing I dont encourage is this idea of concealing the vegetables from the child. The message you send is that vegetables are so unpleasant that you have to fool the child to get him to eat them, exactly the message that will lead to a life of avoiding vegetables.

314 Part IV: The Part of Tens Starting Early Children learn their eating habits at a very young age, age 2 or even younger.

From the time they can eat solid or even semi-solid food, they should be given choices of vegetables. I do not recommend using bottled vegetables, since they are often filled with salt and sugar, but rather making the vegetables into small portions yourself.

Give the child the vegetable to eat by itself, not with a choice of fatty things or sweet things that he will gravitate towards. Do not threaten that the good stuff comes only after the vegetables are eaten. Vegetables must be seen as part of the good stuff.

And, of course, set an example. Let him see you eating and enjoying the vegetables. The message will come through loud and clear.

Letting Children Pick Children love to feel that they have power. Give them the power to pick the vegetables in the market that they and you will eat. Move around to the different colors, explaining that the reason for the different colors is that each color represents a different kind of food that they need in their body. Get a rainbow of vegetables.

Try to know what the vegetables contain so you can explain to the child.

Much of that information is in Chapter 2. This vegetable gives you this vitamin and mineral. That vegetable gives you that one. Your body uses them all to create a healthy person.

Involving Children in Food Preparation When you ask children to describe their earliest memories, they often talk happily about helping their grandmother make some kind of food. Many of the chefs in this book began cooking by their grandmothers or mothers side.

Preparing food together can be a great bonding experience between you and your child, and it also provides you with the opportunity to teach good nutrition. If your child helps you to prepare vegetables, he will want to try what he has prepared.

Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Encourage Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables 315 Have your child create his or her own nutrition plan for a day and discuss every part of it, pointing out what is carbohydrate, protein, fat, the balance among those foods, and how they affect his or her diabetes. Use the food guide pyramid or the childs nutrition plan as a guide for planning, showing the important role that vegetables play in the plan.

Never prepare one meal for your diabetic child and another for the rest of the family. Everyone can benefit from the better choices you make with your childs nutritious food. The child also realizes that eating isnt punishment for a person with diabetes because the whole family eats the same way.

Keeping Problem Foods Out of Sight and Good Foods in Easy View If potato chips or creamy cookies sit on the kitchen counter, can you blame your child (or yourself) for grabbing a handful every time he or she goes by?

Dont buy these foods in the first place. If you do, keep them out of sight. You know what happens when you walk up to a buffet table. You can more easily avoid what you dont see.

On the other hand, keep fruits and vegetables in plain sight. Have carrot sticks and celery sticks easily available. Keep some cooked broccoli and cauliflower in the refrigerator.

Again, your child follows your example. If you raid the freezer for ice cream, dont be surprised to see your child do the same thing. If you raid the refrigerator for broccoli or asparagus, that is what your child will do as well. The great benefit to you when you set an example for your child is the excellent nutrition that you get.

Growing a Garden Even if all you have is a small box, you can show your child where vegetables come from, how they grow, when to pick them, and the fun of eating what you grow. Plus, foods that you grow and pick yourself, just at the peak of taste, are a totally different experience from what you get at the market. Only the farmers market can come close. So if you cant possibly grow your own, take your child to a farmers market. They are everywhere.

316 Part IV: The Part of Tens If you do have a little space, here are a few recommendations from an old farmer (me). Grow some bush beans from seeds for the beautiful flowers that precede the delicious and plentiful beans, and to demonstrate what can come from a tiny seed. They dont require staking up like pole beans. Grow some beets and carrots, also from seeds, to show that foods grow under the earth as well as above the earth, and they get pretty sweet at that. Grow some tomatoes and zucchini from plants to show how things can grow in abundance from only one or two plants that start very tiny.

Let your child do the picking. The thrill of picking your own food is not to be missed. If you cant pick in your own garden, pick where you can pay for the produce in another garden.

Finding Vegetable Recipes They Like In the age of the Internet, the availability of great recipes is almost overwhelming. In this book you will find a tiny portion of what is out there.

Brilliant chefs are working to produce recipes that make us salivate. Your children will love the results.

Appendix D has my recommendations for sources for great recipes, not just for people with diabetes, but for everyone. One of the central themes in all my books about diabetes is that people with diabetes can eat great food.

They can eat just about anything as long as the portions are appropriate.

You dont have to go to vegetarian sources to find great vegetable recipes.

Even restaurants that feature meat know how to cook vegetables. Youll be amazed at the creative ways that chefs prepare zucchini, carrots, squash, spinach, and so forth.

Try watching some of the cooking shows on TV as you exercise. Check the schedule and try to exercise when the vegetable cooking is being shown.

The only problem is that you may want to stop exercising and start cooking.

Resist until you have done your thirty minutes or more.

Stir Frying One of the best ways to cook vegetables ending with a delicious dish without adding a lot of fat is to stir fry. You use very little oil and the vegetables come out hot and delicious. The natural tastes of the vegetables are sealed in. The Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Encourage Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables 317 Chinese have been doing it this way for generations. Until they adopted our Western styles of cooking and eating, diabetes was not much of a problem among the Chinese.

Stir fry many different kinds of vegetables together to make a vegetable medley. Some may take a little longer or a little shorter to fry so put the ones together that take the same time. A meal made up just with stir-fried vegetables can be all your child needs to realize how delicious vegetables can be.

You dont have to throw in any chicken or beef. That is an important message to send your child. A meal can be complete without animal protein. As I have tried to emphasize in this new edition, eating vegetarian is a very healthful way to go.

Using a Dip Sometimes dipping the vegetables into a delicious dip that you prepare can make the vegetables even more delicious, desirable, and easy to eat. Here is a simple dill dip mix that your child will love:  12 cup dried dill weed  12 cup dried minced onion  12 cup dried parsley  12 cup Beau Monde seasoning Combine the ingredients in a bowl and store in a tight container. Label it with instructions for use. When needed, combine 1 cup lowfat mayonnaise, 1 cup lowfat yogurt and 3 tablespoons of dill dip mix and blend well. Your child will love it with all vegetables.

Knowing the Right Sized Portion A 2-year-old child requires a lot less than a 20-year old adult. The recommended serving size of vegetables for a toddler is a tablespoon per year of age. If you want to get your 2-year old to eat five of his servings of vegetables, all you have to do is get him to eat ten tablespoons during the course of the day. Thats a lot easier than you thought. If your child wants more, dont stop him!

Contents Ten Ways to Encourage Children to Eat 318 Part IV: The Part of Tens More Fruits and Vegetables 313 With so little that has to be eaten to reach the daily goal, it may be easier to stick to just one or two vegetables on any given day. Today is carrot and bean day while tomorrow is beet and zucchini day. Vegetables can be fun!

Starting Early 314 Giving Fruit Juice Letting Children Pick 314 You would never think of offering your child a cigarette, would you? Why would you ever offer your child a can of soda? Chapter 2 makes it pretty clear that there is little difference in the negative consequences of cigarettes or soda or fruit drink, for that matter. If you want to get some more fruit into Involving Children in Food Preparation 314 your child and he wont eat enough solid fruit, give him juice. You can get juice from just about any fruit and many vegetables.

You can also make delicious fruit smoothies with lots of fruit, some juice, and a little yogurt. Kids love them!

Keeping Problem Foods Out of Sight Dont buy the canned variety, which always has too much salt in it for some and Good Foods in Easy View 315 dumb reason. Get a juicer and make your own. The wonderful possibilities of putting together all kinds of fruit flavors is easily available if you make your own. Connect the drinking of juice with some kind of celebration. In our house we have juice with breakfast every morning and clink our glasses Growing a Garden 315 together as we say, To life!

However, note that we have tried to reduce kilocalories by reducing fat and sugar intake as much as possible  with the agreement of the chefs  as well as keeping salt intake on the low side.

The meal you receive in the restaurant may not be exactly what you find here, especially because chefs change often; also, chefs sometimes cook for 100 or more people, and their measurements may not be exact every time.

Most food must be prepared rapidly in a restaurant and not the same way.

Appendix C Conversions of Weights, Measures, and Sugar Substitutes Do you know how many tablespoons are in a cup? How many grams are in a pound? And how do you choose between all those sugar substitutes on the market? What if you need to convert an oven temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit? This appendix offers some information to help you answer those questions.

Conversions The following list provides some common measurement conversions.

1 teaspoon = 13 tablespoon 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons 2 tablespoons = 18 cup (1 ounce) 4 tablespoons = 14 cup 513 tablespoons = 13 cup 8 tablespoons = 12 cup 16 tablespoons = 1 cup 1 cup = 12 pint 2 cups = 1 pint 2 pints = 1 quart 4 quarts = 1 gallon 1 pound = 16 ounces 1 fluid ounce = 2 tablespoons 16 fluid ounces = 1 pint 338 Part V: Appendixes Table C-1 explains how to convert specific measurements. For example, if you have 3 ounces of mushrooms, how many grams of mushrooms do you have?

To find out, multiply 3 by 28.35 (you have 85.05 grams).

When a recipe calls for only a few teaspoons of sugar, you may want to use table sugar (also known as sucrose). When the recipe calls for 14 cup of sugar or more, then substitution with a noncaloric sweetener of your choice will definitely save you kilocalories. There are also sweeteners besides glucose that do contain kilocalories but offer other advantages, such as not raising the blood glucose as fast. (We discuss your sweet options in more detail in Chapter 2.) The following sweeteners contain kilocalories that are added into the total kilocalorie count. Theyre absorbed differently than glucose, so they affect the blood glucose differently.

Fructose, found in fruits and berries  Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries  Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants Non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners are often much sweeter than table sugar. Therefore, much less of this type of sweetener is required to accomplish the same level of sweetness as sugar. The current artificial sweeteners (from oldest to newest) include the following:  Saccharin  Aspartame  Acesulfame-K  Sucralose If you plan to substitute another sweetener for sugar, check out Table C-3 to find the measurements needed to achieve equal sweetness.

You can find a number of excellent books and even more recipes on Web sites. You can generally count on the recipes in books to contain the nutrients they list, but Web recipes may not be as reliable; you need to evaluate the site before accepting the recipes. You can trust the sites that we list here. You can find them by typing in the address or by going to Dr. Rubins Web site at www.

drrubin.com.
