Widespread media coverage, though, combined with often contradictory or partial product claims, has contributed to confusion in the minds of some consumers and professionals as to how to navigate the growing array of options.

Is doing one more crossword puzzle the best thing I can do for my brain? Or is it taking some vitamin supplements? Why are both physical and mental exercises so important, and complementary to each other? Why is managing stress as critical to cognitive health as, say, finding stimulating activities to do? What is the value of new brain training games, and how can I evaluate and compare them?

For the Brain health Across The Lifespan conference, I wanted to bring the best speaker and resources on the topic of brain fitness. Asking around dozens of colleagues, I came to hear the name SharpBrains over and over  peers mentioned how Dr. Elkhonon Goldberg and Alvaro Fernandez, co-founders of SharpBrains and co-authors of this guide, had been providing much-needed quality information about the growing field of brain fitness. This is why I invited Alvaro Fernandez to speak at our conference in 2008 and why I am honored to write this foreword.

VIII IX Foreword Neuroscientist Dr. Elkhonon Goldberg and educator and executive Alvaro Fernandez have been working for years with dozens of scientists and experts to answer questions like those above. They founded SharpBrains, a market research company that covers the healthcare and educational applications Introduction: of neuroscience, to provide information and services to its impressive roster of clients, including leading healthcare providers, insurance companies, Debunking 10 Brain and Brain Fitness Myths universities, and more. I am pleased that they have now distilled much information and advice into this practical and thought-provoking guide.

You are a lifelong learner. You may also be a caregiver, or a professional in fields such as healthcare, education, or psychology. The goal of this guide is to help you make informed decisions about brain health and cognitive fitness, based on latest scientific findings. With this guide, the first of its kind, we want to help you navigate the growing number of studies, new products and confusing myths and claims that are part of the emerging brain fitness field.

Only two years ago, the word brain would have rarely been seen next to fitness or training. Today, not a week goes by without a significant media report or announcement linking those precise words.

The flood of recent global news coverage on brain fitness and brain training reflects a growing interest in natural, non drug-based interventions to keep our brains sharp as we age. This interest is very timely, given an aging population, increasing life span, increasing prevalence of Alzheimers rates, a complex changing environment that places more lifelong cognitive demands on our brains than ever and soaring health care costs in the U.S. that place emphasis on prevention and lifestyle changes.

2007 was a turning point for the brain fitness field with a jump in media coverage throughout the year. The first notable press coverage was a Time/CNN special in January 2007. In June, a full issue of the Journal of Gerontology was devoted to cognitive training. The year ended with a PBS special titled X XI Introduction Introduction The Brain Fitness Program in December. Why is this happening? There were Moreover, we need better definitions, a better taxonomy of key concepts.

significant scientific breakthroughs linking cognitive training to lasting cognitive As we emphasize in this guide, mental exercise or brain training goes beyond improvements. Multiple studies were published (including the ACTIVE and mental activity. It refers to the structured use of cognitive exercises or techniques IMPACT studies examined in depth later in this guide) that showed a clear causal aimed at improving specific brain functions. Yet, this level of analysis is often relationship between cognitive training and cognitive improvements. Products missing in popular media coverage.

The Brain and Brain Fitness 101 hIGhLIGhTs  The brain is composed of a number of specialized regions serving distinct functions.

Our life and productivity depend on a variety of brain functions, not just one.

There is nothing inherently fixed in the trajectory of how brain functions evolve as we age.

In order to make informed decisions about brain health and brain training, you need to first understand the underlying organization of the human brain and how it evolves across our lifespan.

1.1. BrAIN sTruCTurEs The dominant structure of the human brain is cal ed the cerebrum, which consists of the grey, curly cortex. The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres (right and left), each consisting of four lobes, and controls higher mental functions.

As you can see in Figure 1, the four lobes of the brain are the occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal lobes.

1 The Brain and Brain Fitness 101 The Brain and Brain Fitness 101 Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions.

The frontal lobes (behind the forehead) are primarily responsible for decision-making, planning, problem-solving, and certain forms of attention.

They are also involved in motor control, certain aspects of language and memory, social behavior and emotions.

The occipital lobes (at the back of the brain) are devoted to vision.

The temporal lobes (next to the temples) are responsible mostly for memory formation, language, hearing and object perception.

The parietal lobes are responsible mostly for certain forms of attention, spatial processing and the manipulation of objects.

of how we learn, remember, problem-solve, and pay attention rather than with any actual knowledge. Any task can be broken down into the different cognitive skills or functions needed to complete that task successfully.

The fields of neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, and thus cognitive training are based on the framework that cognition consists of different mental functions which are based on specific constellations of brain structures. In Table 1, you can browse through the main brain functions involved in cognition. For more discussion on one specific brain function, attention, see the interview at the end of this chapter with Dr. Posner, a pioneer in this area.

Along with speed of processing, other brain functions decline over time.

Neurogenesis is the ability to create new neurons and connections hippocampus (in the temporal lobe) than London bus drivers (Maguire, Woollett, between neurons throughout a lifetime. The latter process is also referred & Spiers, 2006). This is explained by the fact that the hippocampus is important to as synaptogenesis. Neuroscientists often tend to distinguish between for forming and accessing complex memories, including spatial memories neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, but for reasons of simplicity we will refer necessary to navigate efficiently. Taxi drivers have to navigate around London to both with a combined term neurogenesis. This new paradigm contrasts with whereas bus drivers follow a limited set of routes. Thus the hippocampus of taxi traditional ideas of the human brain being a fixed and essentially limited system driver is particularly stimulated and gets to change over time.

Brain fitness is our brains ability to readily create additional connections hIGhLIGhTs: between neurons, and even to promote new neurons in certain parts of the brain.

There is not one single attention, but three separate functions of Research in neuropsychology and neuroscience shows that vigorous mental activity attention: alerting, orienting, and executive attention.

Bob and I are devoting much time to raising awareness of the problem and I have learned to trust him. Especially in the beginning, it wasnt always the need to find and implement good solutions for cognitive care. Our foundation easy to fully accept and follow his judgment, but I have seen how little by little supports community, grass-roots approaches to helping TBI survivors and their he grew perfectly able to recreate his role as a husband and as a father, and families.

It has been wonderful to see that that Bob survived thanks to the excellent care he received from the military happen. It has been a miracle.

along the way, we are focusing first on helping military victims.

Bob has been a very fortunate survivor of traumatic brain injury.

For example, we recently funded four scholarships for TBI-related research, There are over a million cases of TBI every year. Many of them are and also bought 300 mattresses for a small non-profit that helps patients and military-related (a recent RAND study estimates that over 300,000 their spouses rebuild their lives once they have to leave Army bases-many of US service members have sustained TBI during assignments in whom cannot afford to move all their belongings, including beds and mattresses, Iraq or Afghanistan), but also happen in civilian life, mainly due out of the bases.

to traffic accidents or sports concussions. What do we know today And there are many more things to do. For example, while many more about how to prevent and treat TBI?

soldiers are getting better care, that is not always the case with National Guard reservists who, despite having a dedicated branch of the armed forces oversee The Iraq War is literally re-writing the book, the way researchers and doctors their progress, are often more at risk of living with undetected TBI since they see and tackle the problem. Most of the progress is happening in the military, dont have to report to bases once they are back.

but I hope that transfers into benefits for civilians, too. From a preventive point It is also not clear that the military (as well as insurance companies) are of view, the military has been stepping up to improve the body armor of soldiers, always willing to pay for the long-term costs of care.

hIGhLIGhTs  Thanks to lifelong neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, our lifestyles and actions play a meaningful role in how our brains physically change.

There is no general solution to brain maintenance. A multi-pronged approach centered on nutrition, stress management, and both physical and mental exercise is recommended for better brain health.

In Chapter 1 you learned about brain functions and neuroplasticity. As you will discover in the present chapter, the idea of brain maintenance rests upon these two key concepts. Before focusing on brain training in Chapter 3 we would like to give you now an overall view of what one can do to maintain good brain health.

2.1. Why yOur LIFEsTyLE MATTErs The latest scientific research shows that specific lifestyles and actions can, no matter our age, improve the health and level of functioning of our brains.

Such improvement can happen thanks to neuroplasticity that is, when the rate of creation and survival of new neurons in certain parts of the brain is increased, or when the rate of creation and survival of synapses (the connections between 30 31 The 4 Pillars of Brain Maintenance The 4 Pillars of Brain Maintenance neurons) speeds up, or when a neurochemical environment is nurtured in our molecules. Our brain is dependent on dietary fat intake to get enough fat y brains to support information processing.

Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in cold-water fish (such as mackerel, The nice thing about discovering that our lifestyle can affect brain functions herring, salmon, and tuna), kiwi, and walnuts. Docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, is that it puts our brain health largely under our own control. However there is is the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in cell membranes in the brain.

Mental Exercise vs. Mental Activity hIGhLIGhTs  Mental or brain exercise goes beyond mental activity. It is the structured use of cognitive exercises or techniques aimed at improving specific brain functions.

Mental exercise (or brain training) can be delivered in a number of ways: meditation, cognitive therapy, cognitive training.

Computerized brain training programs can help get a complete mental workout In this chapter we focus on mental exercise  which we will call brain training, to clearly distinguish it from mental activity in general. First we try to define what brain training is. Then we highlight the different way you can get some brain training. Finally we focus on brain training software programs.

In Chapter 2 we showed that brain maintenance includes balanced nutrition, stress management, physical exercise and brain exercise. We also reported that numerous studies have shown that intellectual activity in general is good for the brain and may help build up cognitive reserve.

Well-designed training programs may help exercise different from daily mental activities? Lets take the example of physical train and develop other parts.

Physical activity occurs whenever we move our body or engage in improving specific brain functions, brain training includes a range of researcha leisure activity that involves moving our body (e.g., playing pool). Physical supported techniques or approaches, such as cognitive therapy and meditation, exercise (e.g. jogging) refers to the repeated and structured activity of particular along with the most popular brain fitness software.

Mental activity takes place whenever one is awake, ranging from merely day Cognitive Therapy dreaming to reading a book or learning a new language.

This points out to the key word in brain training: variety. One needs a Recently, Dr. Aaron Becks daughter, Dr. Judy Beck, has successfully variety of challenging exercises in order to stimulate the whole brain. Recent used CT to help dieters acquire new skills in order to achieve their goals (see recommendations made by a panel of experts reviewing a poll by the American Dr. Becks interview at the end of this Chapter). According to Dr. Beck, the main Society on Aging (2006) stated: A single activity, no matter how challenging, message of CT and its application in the diet world is that problems losing is not sufficient to sustain the kind of mental acuity that virtually everyone weight are not the dieters fault. These problems reflect the lack of skills that can achieve. Even if ones goal is to improve memory functions, other brain can be acquired through training. What skills is Dr. Beck talking about? Mostly functions need stimulation to achieve that goal. For instance, attention and executive functions: the skills to plan in advance, to motivate oneself, to monitor concentration are essential to good memorization.

This is why to determine whether Structured sets of brain exercises designed to train specific brain areas and a brain training software works it is crucial to (a) understand the claims made functions have been used by the military and by clinical neuropsychologists for by the developer as to what abilities are trained, (b) find well conducted studies a long time.

Throughout my life I have been fascinated by how the mind works. Both from There is too much pressure on kids as well as their teachers today and a the research point of view and the practical one: how can scientists increasing growing number of problems. Yet, I do not see that schools are applying the best knowledge improve kids lives? We now live in a truly exciting era in which knowledge of how minds work.

Some readers may be skeptical of the claim that school work is Parents are usually both very skeptical, since they have been promised more demanding today than, say, twenty years ago. They may say too many things too many times by experts, and open-minded to ideas with kids are simply becoming lazy. What do you say to that?

All people want to succeed, in life if not in since they were educated when scientists still believed the brain was pretty school.

I am afraid that many schools are too quick to diagnose ADD/ADHD MEMOry TrAINING IN ThE CLAssrOOM and consider drugs as the only potential intervention. The label itself can be misleading and counterproductive. School psychologists have wonderful You mention a lack of capacity to deal with demands.

hIGhLIGhTs  Different people face different cognitive demands, and have different starting points, so there is no general solution for everyone and everything.

As in physical fitness, informed consumers and professionals must ask themselves: What are the goals we want to accomplish? What specific cognitive functions are we trying to improve on? In what timeframe?

What budget can we spend on this?

The state of the research does not allow for strong prescriptions or rankings of products: we want to offer you the best information available today so that you can make better informed decisions on what program, if any, may be worth trying for you, your client, patient or loved-one.

When evaluating a software program we recommend asking the diet, stress management, physical exercise and brain exercise. Novelty, variety following 10 questions: and challenge should be incorporated in daily life in a variety of ways.

1. are there scientists, ideally neuropsychologists, and a Age has to be taken in the equation when one wonders what skills need to scientific advisory board behind the program? Neuropsychologists be trained. As you know the brain changes as we age. Some brain areas, such as specialize in measuring and understanding human cognition and brain the frontal lobes, may need extra workout to increase neuroprotection.

For instance, in the cognitive skill i am exercising? What are the specific financial domain, Dr. Steenbarger differentiates between short-term and long-benefits claimed for using this program? Some programs present term traders. The cognitive abilities needed for both types of traders in order to the benefits in such an imprecise way that it is impossible to tell if they be successful are different. The goal of short-term traders is to be able to process will have any results or not...brain exercise itself is a very vague claim, large amounts of information and quickly see patterns in order to make effective because activities like gardening or learning a new language provide decisions. The underlying cognitive functions are then speed of processing and brain exercise too. You need to see something more specific, like what working memory. In contrast, for long-term traders, analytical skills are the most cognitive or emotional skill that program is aimed at.

That makes sense, based on what we know.

It has previously been shown that this skill can be improved with training, so Cognitive abilities evolve in different ways as we age and some typically we wanted to see what effect it would have on the driving performance of older start to decline in our thirties. Cognitive interventions may help train and adults, and whether the training would be more or less effective than a traditional improve those abilities and there is already research that strongly indicates driving simulation course.

researchers refine assessments and training programs.

Both groups driving performance improved right after their respective programs, but most benefits of the driving simulator disappeared by month eighteen. The speed-of-processing intervention helped participants not only improve useful field of view, the skill that was directly trained, but it also transferred into real-life driving, and the results were sustained after eighteen months. And, by the way, the evaluation was as real as one can imagine: a fourteen mile open road evaluation.

Faster speed-of-processing seemed to enable adults to react better to unexpected events that require a fast response and to reduce by forty percent the number of dangerous maneuvers on real roads (defined as those that required the training instructor to intervene during the evaluation).

LOOkING AhEAD Research like this seems to present major opportunities for society. For example, would insurance companies, or the AARP, want to sponsor more research and evaluate whether to offer this type of training to their members? Will major employers see opportunities to improve the performance of older employees by identifying the cognitive skills that may need the most improvement and offering tailored training? We could speculate 134 135 Chapter 6: ready for the Future?

The goal of this guide is to help you navigate the emerging, dynamic, field of brain fitness. We hope we have achieved our goal! We also realize that we have raised many questions because of the emerging nature of this field. In particular, we cannot prescribe specific brain training programs: we can just offer the most relevant and updated information, and leave it up to you, the informed consumer or professional, to exercise your brain and make appropriate decisions.

In this final chapter our aim is to describe the trends we think are important in order to help you be ready for the future. Consumers will be more and more aware that brain health is critical for healthy and successful aging. Informed and proactive adults will look for solutions to integrate brain fitness to their everyday activities. Professionals will identify opportunities to offer new services and programs. We hope this chapter will give you ideas as to how to introduce brain fitness in your personal life and/or your workplace.

7.1. ThE CAsE FOr sOCIAL ENGAGEMENT You may remember the answer of Dr. Art Kramer in Chapter 2 when asked about the top key lifestyle habits that help delay Alzheimers symptoms and improve overall brain health: Ideally, combine both physical and mental stimulation along with social interactions. Why not take a good walk with friends to discuss a book?

This is why you will find below a few questions to help you delve deeper into the topics discussed in The SharpBrains Guide. We suggest that you discuss these questions with your friends, loved ones, the members of your book club, at a meeting of fellow professionals, etc.

Thinking about the questions by yourself would be a stimulating intellectual exercise but discussing the questions with a group of people would boost the power of this brain exercise. Indeed, recent findings suggest that social contact may help us improve our brain functions. For instance, in 2008, Ybarra and his colleagues randomly assigned participants (aged 18-21) to three groups: 1) a social group, in which the participants engaged in a discussion of a social 144 145 Opening the Debate Opening the Debate issue for 10mn, 2) an intellectual activities group, in which the participants You can use these book club discussion questions to help your book club, solved stimulating tasks (crossword puzzles and the likes) for 10mn, and 3) a friends or colleagues delve deeper into the topics discussed in The SharpBrains control group, in which the participants watched a 10mn clip of Seinfeld.

146 147 Glossary Brain Fitness: the general state of feeling alert, in control, productive. Having the mental abilities required to function in society, in our occupations, in our communities.

Brain Training or Cognitive training: structured set of brain exercises, either computer-based or not, designed to train specific brain areas and functions in targeted ways.

Chronic Stress: ongoing, long-term stress. Continued physiological arousal where stressors interfere with neural function and negatively impact the immune systems defenses.

Cognitive Abilities (or Brain functions): brain-based skil s we need to carry out any task. They have more to do with the mechanisms of how we learn, remember, and pay at ention rather than with any actual knowledge. Examples are memory, attention, and language skills.

Cognitive Reserve (or Brain Reserve): theory that addresses the fact that individuals vary considerably in the severity of cognitive aging and clinical dementia. Mental stimulation, education and occupational level are believed to be major active components of building a cognitive reserve that can help resist the effects of brain disease on cognition.

Cognitive therapy: type of therapy based on the idea that the way people perceive their experience influences their behaviors and emotions. The therapist teaches the patient cognitive and behavioral skills to modify his or her dysfunctional thinking and actions. CT aims at improving specific cognitive skills or behaviors (such as planning and mental flexibility), as well as at helping the individual 149 Glossary combat the symptoms and undesirable effects of clinical conditions (such as references depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, or phobias).

Executive Functions: Abilities that enable goal-oriented behavior, such as the ability to plan, and execute a goal. These include flexibility, theory of mind, anticipation, self-regulation, working memory and inhibition.
